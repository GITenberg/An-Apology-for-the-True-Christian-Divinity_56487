<i>ROBERT BARCLAY</i>,
</h3>


<p class="chapter-head"><i>A Servant of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, called of <span class="smcap">God</span> to the Dispensation
of the </i>Gospel<i> now again revealed, and, after a long
and dark Night of </i>Apostasy<i>, commanded to be preached to
all <span class="smcap">Nations</span>, </i>wisheth Health and Salvation.</p>


<p>As the Condition of Kings and Princes puts Them in
a Station more obvious to the View and Observation
of the World than that of other Men, of whom, as
<i>Cicero</i> observes, neither any Word or Action can be obscure;
so are those Kings, during whose Appearance upon
the Stage of this World it pleaseth the <span class="smcap">Great King</span> of
<i>Kings</i> singularly to make known unto Men the wonderful
Steps of His <i>unsearchable Providence</i>, more signally observed,
and their Lives and Actions more diligently remarked, and
enquired into by Posterity; especially if those Things be
such as not only relate to the outward Transactions of this
World, but also are signalized by the Manifestation or Revelation
of the Knowledge of God in Matters spiritual and
religious. These are the Things that <span class="correction" title="In the original book: rendred">rendered</span> the Lives of
<i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Augustus Cæsar</i>, and <i>Constantine</i> the Great, in former
Times, and of <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, and some other modern
Princes in these last Ages, so considerable.</p>

<p>But among all the Transactions which it hath pleased
God to permit, for the Glory of His Power, and the Manifestation
of His Wisdom and Providence, no Age furnisheth
us with Things so <i>strange</i> and <i>marvellous</i>, whether
with Respect to Matters civil or religious, as these
that have fallen out within the Compass of Thy Time;
who, though Thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth Year
of thy Age, hast yet been a Witness of stranger Things
than many Ages before produced. So that whether we respect
those various Troubles wherein Thou foundest Thyself
engaged while scarce got out of Thy Infancy; the
many different Afflictions, wherewith Men of Thy Circumstances
are often unacquainted; the strange and unparalleled
Fortune that befel Thy Father; Thy own narrow
Escape, and Banishment following thereupon, with
the great Improbability of Thy ever returning, at least
without very much Pains and tedious Combatings; or
finally, the Incapacity Thou wert under to accomplish
such a Design; considering the Strength of those that had
possessed themselves of Thy Throne, and the Terror they
had inflicted upon foreign States; and yet that, after all
this, Thou shouldest be restored without Stroke of Sword,
the Help or Assistance of foreign States, or the Contrivance
and Work of human Policy; all these do sufficiently declare
that it is the <i>Lord’s Doing</i>, which, as it is marvellous
in our Eyes, so it will justly be a Matter of Wonder and
Astonishment to Generations to come; and may sufficiently
serve, if rightly observed, to confute and confound that
<i>Atheism</i> wherewith this Age doth so much abound.</p>

<p>As the Vindication of the <i>Liberty of Conscience</i> (which
Thy Father, by giving Way to the importunate Clamours
of the <i>Clergy</i>, the Answering and Fulfilling of whose unrighteous
Wills has often proved hurtful and pernicious
to Princes, sought in some Part to restrain) was a great
Occasion of those Troubles and Revolutions; so the Pretence
of <i>Conscience</i> was that which carried it on, and
brought it to that Pitch it came to. And though no
Doubt some that were engaged in that Work designed
good Things, at least in the Beginning, albeit always
wrong in the Manner they took to accomplish it, <i>viz.</i> by
carnal Weapons; yet so soon as they had tasted the
Sweets of the Possessions of them they had turned out, they
quickly began to do those Things themselves for which
they had accused others. For their Hands were found full
of Oppression, and <i>they hated the Reproof of Instruction, which
is the Way of Life</i>; and they evilly intreated the Messengers
of the Lord, and caused his Prophets to be beaten and imprisoned,
and persecuted his People, whom he had called
and gathered out from among them, whom he had made to
beat their <i>Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks</i>,
and not to learn <i>carnal War</i> any more: But he raised
them up, and armed them with <i>spiritual Weapons</i>, even with
his own Spirit and Power, whereby they testified in the
Streets and High-ways, and publick Markets and Synagogues,
against the <i>Pride</i>, <i>Vanity</i>, <i>Lusts</i>, and <i>Hypocrisy</i> of that
Generation, who were righteous in their own Eyes; though
often cruelly intreated therefore: And they faithfully prophesied
and foretold them of their judgment and Downfal,
which came upon them; as by several Warnings and
Epistles, delivered to <i>Oliver</i> and <i>Richard Cromwell</i>, the <i>Parliament</i>,
and other then <i>Powers</i>, yet upon Record, doth appear.</p>

<p>And after it pleased God to restore Thee, what Oppressions,
what Banishments, and evil Intreatings they have
met with, by Men pretending Thy Authority, and cloaking
their Mischief with Thy Name, is known to most Men
in this Island; especially in <i>England</i>, where there is scarce
a Prison that hath not been filled with them, nor a Judge
before whom they have not been haled; <i>though they could never
yet be found guilty</i> of any Thing that might deserve that Usage.
Therefore the Sense of their Innocency did no Doubt greatly
contribute to move thee, three Years ago, to cause some
Hundreds of them to be set at Liberty: For indeed their
Sufferings are singular, and obviously distinguishable from
all the rest of such as live under Thee in these two Respects.</p>

<p>First, <i>In that among all the Plots contrived by others against
Thee, since Thy Return into </i>Britain<i>, there was never any, owned
of that People, found or known to be guilty, </i>(though many of
them have been taken and imprisoned upon such Kind of
Jealousies)<i> but were always found innocent and harmless, </i>as became
the Followers of Christ<i> not coveting after, nor contending
for the Kingdoms of this World, but subject to every Ordinance of
Man, for Conscience Sake</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>In that in the hottest Times of Persecution, and the
most violent Prosecution of those Laws made against Meetings, </i>being
clothed with Innocency<i>, they have boldly stood to their
Testimony for God, without creeping into Holes or Corners, or once
hiding themselves, </i>as all other Dissenters have done<i>; but daily
met, according to their Custom, in the publick Places appointed for
that End; </i>so that none of Thy Officers can say of them<i>,
That they have surprized them in a Corner, overtaken them in a private
Conventicle, or catched them lurking in their secret Chambers; nor
needed they to send out Spies to get them, whom they were sure daily
to find in their open Assemblies, testifying for God and His Truth</i>.</p>

<p>By which those who have an Eye to see, may observe
their Christian Patience and Courage, Constancy and
Suffering joined in one, more than in any other People
that differ from them, or oppose them. And yet, in the
midst of those Troubles, Thou canst bear Witness, that as
on the one Part, they never sought to detract from Thee,
or to render Thee and Thy Government odious to the
People, by nameless and scandalous Pamphlets and Libels;
so on the other Hand they have not spared to admonish,
exhort, and reprove Thee; and have faithfully
discharged their Consciences towards Thee, without flattering
Words, as ever the true Prophets in ancient Times
used to do to those Kings and Princes, under whose Power
Violence and Oppression was acted.</p>

<p>And although it is evident by Experience to be most
agreeable both to divine Truth, and human Policy, to allow
every one to serve God according to their Consciences;
nevertheless those other Sects, who for the most Part
durst not peep out in the Times of Persecution, while these
innocent People stood bold and faithful, do now combine
in a joint Confederacy, notwithstanding all the Former Janglings
and Contentions among themselves, to render us
odious; seeking unjustly to wrest our Doctrine and Words,
as if they were both inconsistent with Christianity and civil
Society; so that to effectuate this their Work of Malice
against us, they have not been ashamed to take the Help,
and commend the Labours, of some invidious <i>Socinians</i> against
us. So do <i>Herod</i> and <i>Pontius Pilate</i> agree to crucify Christ.</p>

<p>But our Practice, known to Thee by good Experience
to be more consistent with Christianity and civil Society,
and the Peace and Welfare of this Island, than that of those
who thus accuse us, doth sufficiently guard us against this
Calumny; and we may indeed appeal to the Testimony of Thy
Conscience, as a Witness for us in the Face of the Nations.</p>

<p>These Things moved me to present the World with a
brief, but true Account of this People’s Principles, in some
short <i>Theological Propositions</i>; which, according to the Will of
God, proving successful, beyond my Expectation, to the
Satisfaction of several, and to the exciting in many a Desire
of being farther informed concerning us, as being every
where evil spoken of; and likewise meeting with publick
Opposition by some, as such will always do, so long as the
<i>Devil rules in the Children of Disobedience</i>; I was thereby farther
engaged, in the Liberty of the Lord, to present to
the World this <i>Apology</i> of the Truth held by those People:
Which, because of Thy Interest in them, and theirs in Thee,
as having first appeared, and mostly increased, in these Nations
under Thy Rule, I make bold to present unto Thee.</p>

<p>Thou knowest, and hast experienced <i>their Faithfulness towards
their God, their Patience in Suffering, their Peaceableness
towards the King, their Honesty, Plainness and Integrity in their
faithful Warnings and Testimonies to Thee</i>; and if Thou wilt
allow Thyself so much Time as to read this, Thou mayest
find <i>how consonant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth,
and right Reason</i>. The Simplicity of their Behaviour, the
Generality of their Condition, as being poor Men and illiterate;
the Manner of their Procedure, being without
the Wisdom and Policy of this World, hath made many
conclude them Fools and Mad-men, and neglect them, as
not being capable of Reason. But though it be to them
as their Crown, thus to be esteemed of the Wise, the
Great, and Learned of this World, and tho’ they rejoice to
be accounted Fools for Christ’s Sake; yet of late some, even
such who in the World’s Account are esteemed both Wise
and Learned, begin to judge otherwise of them, and find,
that they hold forth Things very agreeable both to Scripture,
Reason, and true Learning.</p>

<p>As it is inconsistent with the Truth I bear, so it is far
from me to use this Epistle as an <i>Engine</i> to <i>flatter</i> Thee, the
usual Design of such Works; and therefore I can neither
Dedicate it to Thee, nor crave Thy Patronage, as if thereby
I might have more Confidence to present it to the World,
or be more hopeful of its Success. To God alone I owe
what I have, and that more immediately in Matters spiritual;
and therefore to Him alone, and to the Service of
His Truth, I dedicate whatever Work He brings forth in
me; to whom only the Praise and Honour appertain,
whose Truth needs not the Patronage of worldly Princes;
His Arm and Power being that alone by which it is propagated,
established and confirmed. But I found it upon
my Spirit to take Occasion to present this Book unto Thee;
that as Thou hast been often warned by several of that People,
who are Inhabitants of <i>England</i>; so Thou may’st not
want a seasonable Advertisement from a Member of Thy
ancient Kingdom of <i>Scotland</i>; and that Thou may’st know,
which I hope Thou wilt have no Reason to be troubled at,
that God is raising up and increasing that People in this
Nation. And the Nations shall also hereby know, that the
<i>Truth</i> we profess is not a Work of Darkness, nor propagated
by Stealth; and that we are not ashamed of the <i>Gospel
of Christ</i>, because we know it to be <i>the Power of God unto
Salvation</i>; and that we are no Ways so inconsistent with
Government, nor such Disturbers of the Peace, as our
Enemies, by traducing us, have sought to make the World
believe we are: For which to Thee I dare appeal, as a Witness
of our Peaceableness and Christian Patience.</p>

<p>Generations to come shall not more admire that singular
Step of Divine Providence, in Restoring Thee to Thy
Throne, without outward Bloodshed, than they shall admire
the Increase and Progress of this <i>Truth</i>, without all outward
Help, and against so great Opposition; which shall be none
of the least Things rendering Thy <i>Memory</i> remarkable. God
hath done great Things for Thee; He hath sufficiently shewn
Thee, that it is <i>by Him Princes rule</i>, and that <i>He can pull
down and set up at His Pleasure</i>. He hath often faithfully
warned Thee by His Servants, since He restored Thee to
Thy <i>Royal Dignity</i>, that Thy Heart might not wax wanton
against Him, to forget His Mercies and Providences towards
Thee; whereby He might permit Thee to be soothed up,
and lulled asleep in Thy Sins, by the Flattering of <i>Court-parasites</i>,
who, by their Fawning, are the <i>Ruin</i> of many <i>Princes</i>.</p>

<p>There is no King in the World, who can so experimentally
testify of God’s Providence and Goodness; neither is
there any, who rules so many free People, so many true
Christians: Which Thing renders Thy Government more
Honourable, Thyself more Considerable, than the Accession
of many Nations, filled with slavish and superstitious Souls.</p>

<p>Thou hast tasted of Prosperity and Adversity; Thou
knowest what it is to be banished Thy native Country,
to be over-ruled, as well as to rule, and sit upon the
Throne; and being <i>oppressed</i>, Thou hast Reason to know

<p><i>Forasmuch as that, which above all Things I propose to myself, is to
declare and defend the </i>Truth<i>; for the Service whereof I have given up
and devoted myself, and all that is mine; therefore there is nothing which for
its Sake (by the Help and Assistance of God) I may not attempt. And in this
Confidence, I did sometime ago publish certain Propositions of Divinity, comprehending
briefly the chief Principles and Doctrines of </i>Truth<i>; which appearing
not unprofitable to some, and being beyond my Expectation well received
by many, though also opposed by some envious Ones, did so far prevail, as in
some Part to remove that false and monstrous Opinion, which lying Fame, and
the Malice of our Adversaries, had implanted in the Minds of some, concerning
us and our Doctrines.</i></p>

<p><i>In this Respect it seemed to me not fit to spare my Pains and Labour; and
therefore, being actuated by the same Divine Spirit, and the like Intention of
propagating the Truth, by which I published the Propositions themselves, I
judged it meet to explain them somewhat more largely at this Time, and defend
them by certain Arguments.</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps my Method of Writing may seem not only different, but even contrary,
to that which is commonly used by the Men called </i>Divines<i>, with which
I am not concerned: Inasmuch as I confess myself to be not only no Imitator and
Admirer of the </i>School-men<i>, but an Opposer and Despiser of them as such,
by whose Labour I judge the </i>Christian Religion<i> to be so far from being bettered,
that it is rather destroyed. Neither have I sought to accommodate this
my Work to itching Ears, who desire rather to comprehend in their Heads the
sublime Notions of Truth, than to embrace it in their Hearts: For what I have
written comes more from my Heart than from my Head; what I have heard
with the Ears of my Soul, and seen with my inward Eyes, and my Hands have
handled of the </i>Word of Life<i>, and what hath been inwardly manifested to me
of the Things of God, that do I declare; not so much regarding the Eloquence
and Excellency of Speech, as desiring to demonstrate the Efficacy and Operation
of Truth; and if I err sometimes in the former, it is no great Matter; for I
act not here the </i>Grammarian<i>, or the </i>Orator<i>, but the </i>Christian<i>; and
therefore in this I have followed the certain Rule of the </i>Divine Light<i>, and
of the </i>Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p><i>And to make an End; What I have written, is written not to feed the
</i>Wisdom<i> and </i>Knowledge<i>, or rather </i>vain Pride of this World<i>, but to
starve and oppose it, as the little Preface prefixed to the </i>Propositions<i> doth
shew; which, with the Title of them, is as followeth.</i></p>

hath clouded it, that the People might admire and maintain them. And

revealeth him</i>; and seeing <i>the Revelation of the Son is in and by the

the true Knowledge of God hath been, is, and can be only revealed;
who as, by the moving of his own Spirit, he converted the <i>Chaos</i> of
this World into that wonderful Order wherein it was in the Beginning,
and created Man a living Soul, to rule and govern it, so by
the Revelation of the same Spirit he hath manifested himself all
along unto the Sons of Men, both Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles;
which Revelations of God by the Spirit, whether by outward
Voices and Appearances, Dreams, or inward <i>objective Manifestations in
the Heart</i>, were of old the <i>formal Object</i> of their Faith, and remain yet
so to be; <i>since the Object of the Saints’ Faith is the same in all Ages</i>, though
set forth under divers Administrations. Moreover, these divine inward
Revelations, which we make absolutely necessary for the building
up of true Faith, neither do nor can ever contradict the outward
Testimony of the Scriptures, or right and sound Reason. Yet from
hence it will not follow, that these divine Revelations are to be
subjected to the Examination, either of the outward Testimony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a>[Pg iv]</span>
the Scriptures, or of the natural Reason of Man, as to a more noble
or certain Rule or Touchstone: For this divine Revelation, and inward
Illumination, is that which is evident and clear of itself;
forcing, by its own Evidence and Clearness, the well-disposed Understanding
to assent, irresistibly moving the same thereunto; even
as the common Principles of natural <i>Truths</i> move and incline the
Mind to a natural Assent: As, That <i>the Whole is greater than its Part</i>;
That <i>two contradictory Sayings cannot be both true, nor both false</i>: Which
is also manifest, according to our Adversaries Principle, who (supposing
the Possibility of inward divine Revelations) will nevertheless
confess with us, that neither Scripture nor sound Reason will contradict
it: And yet it will not follow, according to them, that the
Scripture, or sound Reason, should be subjected to the Examination
of the divine Revelations in the Heart.</p>

<h4 class="no-break">The Third Proposition.</h4>

<p class="center">Concerning the <span class="smcap">Scriptures</span>.</p>

<p>From these Revelations of the Spirit of God to the Saints, have
proceeded the Scriptures of Truth, which contain, 1. A faithful
historical Account of the Actings of God’s People in divers Ages,
with many singular and remarkable Providences attending them.
2. A prophetical Account of several Things, whereof some are already
past, and some yet to come. 3. A full and ample Account
of all the chief Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, held forth in
divers precious Declarations, Exhortations and Sentences, which,
by the moving of God’s Spirit, were at several Times, and upon
sundry Occasions, spoken and written unto some Churches and their
Pastors: Nevertheless, because they are only a Declaration of the
<i>Fountain</i>, and not the <i>Fountain</i> itself, therefore they are not to be
esteemed the principal Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet
the <i>adequate primary Rule</i> of <i>Faith and Manners</i>. Nevertheless, as that
which giveth a true and faithful Testimony of the first Foundation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a>[Pg v]</span>
they are and may be esteemed a <i>secondary Rule, subordinate</i> to the
<i>Spirit</i>, from which they have all their Excellency and Certainty; for
as by the inward Testimony of the Spirit we do alone truly know
them; so they testify, that <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>the Spirit is that Guide by which the
Saints are led into <i>all Truth</i>: Therefore, according to the Scriptures,
the Spirit is the first and principal Leader. And seeing we do therefore
receive and believe the Scriptures, because they proceeded from
the Spirit; therefore also the Spirit is more originally and principally
the Rule, according to that received Maxim in the Schools,
<i>Propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale</i>. Englished
thus: <i>That for which a Thing is such, that Thing itself is more such</i>.</p>

<p>According to which Principle (or <i>Hypothesis</i>) all the Objections
against the Universality of Christ’s Death are easily
solved; neither is it needful to recur to the Ministry of Angels, and
those other miraculous Means, which, they say, God makes use of,
to manifest the Doctrine and History of Christ’s Passion, unto such
who (living in those Places of the World where the outward Preaching
of the Gospel is unknown) have well improved the first and
common Grace; for hence it well follows, that as some of the old
Philosophers might have been saved, so also may now some (who by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a>[Pg vii]</span>
Providence are cast into those remote Parts of the World, where
the Knowledge of the History is wanting) be made Partakers of the
Divine Mystery, if they receive and resist not that Grace, <a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>a <i>Manifestation
whereof is given to every Man to profit withal</i>. This certain Doctrine
then being received (<i>to wit</i>) that there is an Evangelical and
Saving Light and Grace in all, the Universality of the Love and
Mercy of God towards Mankind (both in the Death of his beloved
Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Manifestation of the
Light in the Heart) is established and confirmed against all the Objections
of such as deny it. Therefore <a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><i>Christ hath tasted Death for every
Man</i>; not only <i>for all Kinds of Men</i>, as some vainly talk, but <i>for
every one, of all Kinds</i>; the Benefit of whose Offering is not only extended
to such, who have the distinct outward Knowledge of his
Death and Sufferings, as the same is declared in the Scriptures, but
even unto those who are necessarily excluded from the Benefit of
this Knowledge by some inevitable Accident; which Knowledge we
willingly confess to be very profitable and comfortable, but not absolutely
needful unto such, from whom God himself hath with-held
it; yet they may be made Partakers of the Mystery of his Death
(though ignorant of the History) if they suffer his Seed and Light
(enlightening their Hearts) to take Place (in which Light, Communion
with the Father and Son is enjoyed) so as of wicked Men to
become holy, and Lovers of that Power, by whose inward and secret
Touches they feel themselves turned from the Evil to the Good, and
learn <i>to do to others as they would be done by</i>; in which Christ himself
affirms all to be included. As they then have <span class="correction" title="In the original book: falsly">falsely</span> and erroneously
taught, who have denied Christ to have died for all Men; so neither
have they sufficiently taught the Truth, who affirming him to have
died for all, have added the absolute Necessity of the outward Knowledge
thereof, in order to the obtaining its saving Effect; among
whom the <i>Remonstrants</i> of <i>Holland</i> have been chiefly wanting, and
many other Assertors of <i>Universal Redemption</i>, in that they have not
placed the Extent of this Salvation in that Divine and Evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[Pg viii]</span>

Man that comes into the World, which is excellently and evidently

<p>As many as resist not this Light, but receive the same, in them

Holiness, Righteousness, Purity, and all these other blessed Fruits

it is not by our Works wrought in our Will, nor yet by good
Works, considered as of themselves, but by Christ, who is both the
Gift and the Giver, and the Cause producing the Effects in us;
who, as he hath reconciled us while we were Enemies, doth also in

<h4 class="no-break">The Eleventh Proposition.</h4>

<p class="center">Concerning <span class="smcap">Worship</span>.</p>

<p>All true and acceptable Worship to God is offered in the <i>inward</i>
and <i>immediate</i> moving and drawing of his own Spirit,
which is neither limited to Places, Times, or Persons; for though
we be to worship him always, in that we are to fear before him, yet
as to the outward Signification thereof in Prayers, Praises, or Preachings,
we ought not to do it where and when we will, but where and
when we are moved thereunto by the secret Inspirations of his Spirit
in our Hearts, which God heareth and accepteth of, and is never
wanting to move us thereunto, when Need is, of which he himself
is the alone proper Judge. <a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>All other Worship then, both Praises,
Prayers and Preachings, which Man sets about in his own Will,
and at his own Appointment, which he can both begin and end at
his Pleasure, do or leave undone as himself sees meet, whether they
be a prescribed Form, as a Liturgy, or Prayers conceived extemporarily,
by the natural Strength and Faculty of the Mind, they are
all but Superstitions, Will-worship, and abominable Idolatry in the
Sight of God; which are to be denied, rejected, and separated from,
in this Day of his spiritual Arising: <a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>However it might have pleased
him (who winked at the Times of Ignorance, with Respect to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
Simplicity and Integrity of some, and of his own innocent Seed,
which lay as it were buried in the Hearts of Men, under the Mass
of Superstition) to blow upon the dead and dry Bones, and to raise
some Breathings, and answer them, and that until the Day should
more clearly dawn and break forth.</p>

<p>He that desireth to acquire any Art or Science, seeketh first
those Means by which that Art or Science is obtained: If
we ought to do so in Things Natural and Earthly, how much
more then in Spiritual? In this Affair then should our Inquiry be
the more diligent, because he that Errs in the Entrance, is not so
easily brought back again into the Right Way; he that misseth his Road
from the Beginning of his Journey, and is deceived in his first Marks,
at his first setting forth, the greater his Mistake is, the more difficult
will be his Entrance into the Right Way.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Way to the true Knowledge of God.</i></span>Thus when a Man first proposeth to himself the Knowledge of God,
from a Sense of his own Unworthiness, and from the great Weariness
of his Mind, occasioned by the secret Checks of his Conscience,
and the tender yet real Glances of God’s <i>Light</i> upon his Heart; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
earnest Desires he has to be redeemed from his present Trouble, and
the fervent Breathings he has to be eased of his disordered Passions
and Lusts, and to find Quietness and Peace in the certain Knowledge
of God, and in the Assurance of his Love and Good-will towards
him, make his Heart tender, and ready to receive any Impression;
and so (not having then a distinct Discerning) through
Forwardness embraceth any Thing that brings present Ease. If either
through the Reverence he bears to certain Persons, or from the secret
Inclination to what doth comply with his natural Disposition,
he fall upon any Principles or Means by which he apprehends he
may come to know God, and so doth center himself, it will be hard
to remove him thence again, how wrong soever they may be: For
the first Anguish being over, he becomes more hardy; and the
Enemy being near, creates a false Peace, and a certain Confidence,
which is strengthened by the Mind’s Unwillingness to enter again
into new Doubtfulness, or the former Anxiety of a Search.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Jewish Doctors and Pharisees resist Christ.</i></span>This is sufficiently verified in the Example of the <i>Pharisees</i> and
<i>Jewish Doctors</i>, who most of all resisted <i>Christ</i>, disdaining to be esteemed
Ignorant; for this vain Opinion they had of their Knowledge,
hindered them from the true Knowledge; and the mean People,
who were not so much pre-occupied with former Principles, nor
conceited of their own Knowledge, did easily believe. Wherefore
the <i>Pharisees</i> upbraid them, saying, <a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><i>Have any of the Rulers or Pharisees
believed on him? But this People, which know not the Law, are accursed.</i>
This is also abundantly proved by the Experience of all such, as
being secretly touched with the Call of God’s Grace unto them, do
apply themselves to false Teachers, where the Remedy proves worse
than the Disease; because instead of knowing God, or the Things
relating to their Salvation aright, they drink in wrong Opinions of
him; from which it is harder to be disintangled, than while the Soul
remains a Blank, or <i>Tabula rasa</i>. For they that conceit themselves
Wise, are worse to deal with than they that are sensible of their
Ignorance. Nor hath it been less the Device of the Devil, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
Enemy of Mankind, to persuade Men into wrong Notions of God,
than to keep them altogether from acknowledging him; the latter
taking with few, because odious; but the other having been the
constant Ruin of the World: For there hath scarce been a Nation
found, but hath had some Notions or other of Religion; so that not
from their denying any Deity, but from their Mistakes and Misapprehensions
of it, hath proceeded all the Idolatry and Superstition
of the World; yea, hence even Atheism itself hath proceeded: For
these many and various Opinions of God and Religion, being so
much mixed with the Guessings and uncertain Judgments of Men,
have begotten in many the Opinion, That there is no God at all.
This, and much more that might be said, may shew how dangerous
it is to miss in this first Step: <i>All that come not in by the right Door, are
</i>accounted<i> as Thieves and Robbers.</i></p>

<p>This therefore I judged necessary, as a first Principle, in the first
Place, to affirm; and I suppose will not need much farther Explanation
or Defence, as being generally acknowledged by all (and in
these Things that are without Controversy I love to be brief) as
that which will easily commend itself to every Man’s Reason and
Conscience; and therefore I shall proceed to the next Proposition;
which, though it be nothing less certain, yet by the Malice of Satan,
and Ignorance of many, comes far more under Debate.</p>

outward Testimony of the Scriptures, or of the Natural Reason of
Man, as to a more noble or certain Rule and Touchstone; for
this Divine Revelation, and Inward Illumination, is that which
is evident and clear of itself; forcing, by its own Evidence and
Clearness, the well-disposed Understanding to assent, irresistibly

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Revelation by Apostate Christians rejected.</i></span>It is very probable, that many carnal and natural Christians
will oppose this Proposition; who, being wholly unacquainted
with the Movings and Actings of God’s Spirit upon their Hearts,
judge the same nothing necessary; and some are apt to flout at it as
ridiculous: Yea, to that Height are the Generality of Christians apostatized
and degenerated, that though there be not any Thing more
plainly Asserted, more seriously Recommended, or more certainly
Attested to, in all the Writings of the holy Scriptures; yet nothing is
less minded, and more rejected, by all Sorts of Christians, than <i>Immediate
and Divine Revelation</i>; insomuch, that once to lay Claim to it,
is Matter of Reproach. Whereas of old, none were ever judged
Christians, but such as <i>had the Spirit of Christ</i>, Rom. viii. 9. But now
many do boldly call themselves <i>Christians</i>, who make no Difficulty of
confessing they are without it, and laugh at such as say they have it.
Of old they were accounted <i>the Sons of God, who were led by the Spirit
of God</i>, ibid. verse 14. But now many aver themselves Sons of God,
who <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: knowing">know</span> nothing of this Leader; and he that affirms himself so
led, is, by the pretended Orthodox of this Age, presently proclaimed
an Heretick. The Reason hereof is very manifest, <i>viz.</i> Because
many in these Days, under the Name of <i>Christians</i>, do experimentally
find, that they are not actuated, nor led, by God’s Spirit; yea,
many great <i>Doctors</i>, <i>Divines</i>, <i>Teachers</i> and <i>Bishops</i> of Christianity, (commonly
so called) have wholly shut their Ears from hearing, and their
Eyes from seeing, this <i>Inward Guide</i>, and so are become Strangers
unto it; whence they are, by their own Experience, brought to this
Strait, either to confess that they are as yet ignorant of God, and
have only the Shadow of <i>Knowledge</i>, and not the true <i>Knowledge</i> of
him, or that this <i>Knowledge</i> is acquired without Immediate Revelation.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Knowledge Spiritual and Literal distinguished.</i></span>For the better understanding then of this Proposition, we do distinguish
betwixt the certain Knowledge of God, and the uncertain;
betwixt the spiritual Knowledge, and the literal; the saving Heart-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>Knowledge,
and soaring, airy Head-Knowledge. The last, we confess,
may be divers Ways obtained; but the first, by no other Way than
the inward immediate Manifestation and Revelation of God’s Spirit,
shining in and upon the Heart, inlightning and opening the Understanding.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3> Having then proposed to myself, in these Propositions, to
affirm those Things which relate to the true and effectual Knowledge,
which brings Life Eternal with it; therefore I have truly affirmed,
that this Knowledge is no otherways attained, and that none have
any true Ground to believe they have attained it, who have it not
by this Revelation of God’s Spirit.</div>

<p>The Certainty of which Truth is such, that it hath been acknowledged
by some of the most refined and famous of all Sorts of Professors
of Christianity in all Ages; who being truly upright-hearted,
and earnest Seekers of the Lord, (however stated under the Disadvantages
and epidemical Errors of their several Sects or Ages) the
true Seed in them hath been answered by God’s Love, who hath
had Regard to the Good, and hath had of his Elect Ones among all,
who finding a Distaste and Disgust in all other outward Means, even
in the very Principles and Precepts more particularly relative to their
own Forms and Societies, have at last concluded, with <i>One Voice</i>,
That there was no true Knowledge of God, but that which is revealed
inwardly by his own Spirit. Whereof take these following

a modern Author, <i>viz.</i> Dr. <i>Smith</i> of <i>Cambridge</i>, in his Select Discourses,
saith well; “<i>To seek our Divinity merely in Books and Writings, is
to seek the Living among the Dead. We do but in vain many Times seek
God in these, where his Truth is too often not so much Enshrined as Entombed.</i>
Intra te quære Deum, <i>Seek God within thine own Soul: He
is best discerned </i>[Greek: noera epaphê: νοερα επαφη]<i> (as </i>Plotinus<i> phrased it) by an Intellectual
Touch of him. We must</i> see with our Eyes, and hear with our Ears,
and our Hands must handle the Word of Life (<i>to express it in St.
</i>John<i>’s Words</i>) [Greek: hoti tês psychês aisthêsis: ὁτι της ψυχης αισθησις], <i>&amp;c. The <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Soulitself">Soul itself</span> hath its Sense,
as well as the Body.</i> And therefore, <i>David</i>, when he would teach us
to know what the Divine Goodness is, calls not for Speculation,
but Sensation: <i>Taste, and see how good the Lord is</i>. That is not the
best and truest Knowledge of God, which is wrought out by the
Labour and Sweat of the Brain, but that which is kindled within
us, by an heavenly Warmth in our Hearts. <i>And again</i>: There is
a Knowing of the <i>Truth, as it is in Jesus</i>, as it is in a <i>Christ-like Nature</i>;
as it is in that sweet, mild, humble, and loving Spirit of
Jesus, which spreads itself, like a <i>Morning Sun</i>, upon the Souls of
good Men, full of Light and Life. It profits little to know Christ
himself after the Flesh; but he gives his Spirit to good Men, <i>that
searcheth the deep things of God</i>. <i>And again</i>: It is but a thin airy
Knowledge, that is got by mere Speculation, which is ushered in
by Syllogisms and Demonstrations; but that which springs forth
from true Goodness, is [Greek: theioteron ti pasês hypodeixeôs: θειοτερον τι πασης ὑποδειξεως] (as <i>Origen</i> speaketh)
<i>It brings such a Divine Light into the Soul, as is more clear and convincing
than any Demonstration</i>.”</p>

<span class="sidenote">Apostasy and a false Knowledge introduced.</span>That this certain and undoubted Method of the true Knowledge
of God hath been brought out of use, hath been none of the
least Devices of the Devil, to secure Mankind to his Kingdom. For
after the Light and Glory of the Christian Religion had prevailed
over a great Part of the World, and dispelled the thick Mists of the
Heathenish Doctrine of the Plurality of Gods, he that knew there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
was no Probability of deluding the World any longer that Way, did
then puff Man up with a false Knowledge of the true God; setting
him on work to seek God the wrong Way, and persuading him to
be content with such a Knowledge as was of his own acquiring, and
not of God’s teaching. And this Device hath proved the more successful,
because accommodated to the natural and corrupt Spirit and
Temper of Man, who above all Things affects to exalt himself; in
which Exaltation, as God is greatly dishonoured, so therein the
Devil hath his End; who is not anxious how much God is acknowledged
in Words, provided himself be but always served; he matters
not how great and high Speculations the Natural Man entertains of
God, so long as he serves his own Lusts and Passions, and is obedient
to his evil Suggestions and Temptations.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christianity is become an Art, acquired by human Science and Industry.</i></span>Thus <i>Christianity</i> is become
as it were an Art, acquired by human Science and Industry;
like any other Art or Science; and Men have not only assumed
the Name of <i>Christians</i>, but even have procured themselves to be
esteemed as <i>Masters of Christianity</i>, by certain Artificial Tricks, though
altogether Strangers to the Spirit and Life of Jesus. But if we
make a right Definition of a <i>Christian</i>, according to the Scripture,
That <i>he is one who hath the Spirit and is led by it</i>, how many <i>Christians</i>,
yea, and of these great <i>Masters</i> and <i>Doctors of Christianity</i>, so accounted,
shall we justly divest of that Noble Title?</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>By Revelation is the true Knowledge of God.</i></span>If those therefore who have all the other Means of Knowledge, and are
sufficiently Learned therein, whether it be the Letter of the Scripture,
the Traditions of Churches, or the Works of Creation and
Providence, whence they are able to deduce strong and undeniable
Arguments (which may be true in themselves) are not yet to be
esteemed <i>Christians</i>, according to the certain and infallible Definition
above-mentioned; and if the inward and immediate Revelation of
God’s Spirit in the Heart, in such as have been altogether ignorant
of some, and but very little skilled in others, of these Means of attaining
Knowledge, hath brought them to Salvation; then it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
necessarily and evidently follow, that Inward and Immediate Revelation
is the only sure and certain Way to attain the true and saving
Knowledge of God.</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore the last.</p>

<p>Now as this Argument doth very strongly conclude for this Way
of Knowledge, and against such as deny it; so in this Respect it is the
more to be regarded, as the Propositions, from which it is deduced,
are so clear, that our very Adversaries cannot deny them. For as
to the first, it is acknowledged, that many Learned Men may be,
and have been, damned. And as to the second, who will deny but
many illiterate Men may be, and are, saved?
<span class="sidenote">Abel, Seth, Noah, <i>&amp;c. instanced</i>.</span>Nor dare any affirm,
that none come to the Knowledge of God and Salvation by the inward
Revelation of the Spirit, without these other outward Means;
unless they be also so bold as to exclude <i>Abel</i>, <i>Seth</i>, <i>Noah</i>, <i>Abraham</i>,
<i>Job</i>, and all the holy Patriarchs from true Knowledge and Salvation.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> I would however not be understood as if hereby I excluded
those other Means of Knowledge from any Use or Service to
Man; it is far from me so to judge, as concerning the <i>Scriptures</i>, in
the next Proposition, will more plainly appear. The Question is
not, what may be profitable or helpful, but what is absolutely necessary.
Many Things may contribute to further a Work, which yet
are not the main Thing that makes the Work go on.</div>

<p>The Sum then of what is said amounts to this, That where the
true Inward Knowledge of God is, through the Revelation of his
Spirit, there is all; neither is there an absolute Necessity of any
other. But where the best, highest, and most profound Knowledge
is, without this there is nothing, as to the obtaining the great End
of Salvation. This Truth is very effectually confirmed by the first
Part of the Proposition itself, which in few Words comprehendeth
divers unquestionable Arguments, which I shall in brief subsume.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">I.</span>First, <i>That there is no Knowledge of the Father but by the Son</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">II.</span>Secondly, <i>That there is no Knowledge of the Son, but by the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">V.</span>And Lastly, <i>That the same continueth to be the Object of the Saints’ Faith
to this Day</i>.</p>

<p>Of each of these I shall speak a little particularly, and then proceed
to the latter Part.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assert. </i>I.<i> Proved.</i></span>As to the first, viz. <i>That there is no Knowledge of the Father but
by the Son</i>, it will easily be proved, being founded upon the plain
Words of Scripture, and is therefore a fit <i>Medium</i> from whence to
deduce the rest of our Assertions.</div>

<p>For the infinite and most wise God, who is the <i>Foundation</i>, <i>Root</i>
and <i>Spring</i> of all <i>Operation</i>, hath wrought all Things by his Eternal
Word and Son. <a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><i>This is that <span class="smcap">Word</span> that was in the Beginning with God,
and was God, by whom all Things were made, and without whom was not any
Thing made that was made</i>, <a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>This is that <i>Jesus Christ, by whom God created all
Things, by whom, and for whom, all Things were created, that are in Heaven
and in Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or
Principalities, or Powers</i>, Col. i. 16. Who therefore is called, <i>The first-born
of every Creature</i>, Col. i. 15. As then that infinite and incomprehensible
Fountain of Life and Motion operateth in the Creatures
by his own Eternal Word and Power; so no Creature has Access
again unto him but in and by the Son, according to his own express
Words, <i>No Man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son
will reveal him</i>, Mat. xi. 27. Luke x. 22. And again, he himself saith,
<i>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: No Man cometh unto the Father but
by me</i>, John xiv. 6.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> John 1. 1, 2, 3.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Eph. 3. 9.</p></div>

<p>Hence he is fitly called, <i>The Mediator betwixt God and Man</i>: For
having been with God from all Eternity, being himself God, and
also in Time partaking of the Nature of Man; through him is the
Goodness and Love of God conveyed to Mankind, and by him again
Man receiveth and partaketh of these Mercies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Hence is easily deduced the Proof of this first Assertion, thus:</p>

<p>If no Man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the
Son will reveal him; then there is no Knowledge of the Father but
by the Son.</p>

<p>But no Man knoweth the Father <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: but by the Son">but the Son</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is no Knowledge of the Father but by the Son.</p>

<p>The first Part of the Antecedent are the plain Words of Scripture:
The Consequence thereof is undeniable; except one would say,
that he hath the Knowledge of the Father, while yet he knows him
not; which were an absurd Repugnance.</p>

<p>Again, if the Son be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that
no Man cometh unto the Father but by him; then there is no Knowledge
of the Father but by the Son.</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore the last.</p>

<p>The Antecedent are the very Scripture Words: The Consequence
is very evident: For how can any know a Thing, who useth not the
Way, without which it is not knowable? But it is already proved,
that there is no other Way but by the Son; so that whoso uses not
that Way, cannot know him, neither come unto him.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assert. </i>II.<i> Proved.</i></span>Having then laid down this first Principle, I come to the second,
viz. <i>That there is no Knowledge of the Son but by the Spirit</i>; or, <i>That
the Revelation of the Son of God is by the Spirit</i>.</div>

<p>Where it is to be noted, that I always speak of the saving, certain
and necessary Knowledge of God; which that it cannot be acquired
otherways than by the Spirit, doth also appear from many
clear Scriptures. For Jesus Christ, in and by whom the Father
is revealed, doth also reveal himself to his Disciples and Friends
in and by his Spirit: As his Manifestation was outward, when
he testified and witnessed for the Truth in this <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Word">World</span>, and approved
himself faithful throughout; so being now withdrawn, as
to the outward Man, he doth teach and instruct Mankind inwardly,
by his own Spirit; <i>He standeth at the Door and knocketh, and whoso heareth
his Voice and openeth, he comes in</i> to such, <i>Rev.</i> iii. 20. Of this Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>velation
of Christ in him, <i>Paul</i> speaketh, <i>Gal.</i> i. 16. in which he
placeth the Excellency of his Ministry, and the Certainty of his Calling.
And the Promise of Christ to his Disciples, <i>Lo, I am with you to
the End of the World</i>, confirmeth the same Thing; for this is an Inward
and Spiritual Presence, as all acknowledge: But what relates hereto
will again occur.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Proof</i> I.</span>I shall deduce the Proof of this Proposition from
two manifest Places of Scripture: The first is, 1 Cor. i. 11, 12. <i>What
Man knoweth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of a Man which is in him?</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Things of God are known by the Spirit of God.</i></span><i>Even so the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God. Now we
have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that
we might know the Things which are freely given us of God.</i> The Apostle
in the Verses before, speaking of the wonderful Things which are prepared
for the Saints, after he hath declared, that the <i>Natural Man cannot
reach them</i>, adds, that <i>They are revealed by the Spirit of God</i>, Ver. 9,
10. giving this Reason, <i>For the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep
Things of God</i>. And then he bringeth in the Comparison, in the Verses
above-mentioned, very apt, and answerable to our Purpose and Doctrine,
that <i>as the Things of a Man are only known by the Spirit of Man; so
the Things of God are only known by the Spirit of God</i>: That is, that as nothing
below the Spirit of Man (as the Spirit of Brutes, or any other
Creatures) can properly reach unto, or comprehend the Things of a
Man, as being of a nobler and higher Nature; so neither can the Spirit
of Man, or the Natural Man, as the Apostle in the 14th Verse subsumes,
receive nor discern the Things of God, or the Things that are
Spiritual, as being also of an higher Nature; which the Apostle himself
gives for the Reason, saying, <i>Neither can he know them, because they
are Spiritually discerned</i>. So that the Apostle’s Words, being reduced
to an Argument, do very well prove the Matter under Debate, thus:</p>

<p>If that which appertaineth properly to Man, cannot be discerned
by any lower or baser Principle than the Spirit of Man; then cannot
those Things, that properly relate unto God and Christ, be known
or discerned by any lower or baser Thing than the Spirit of God
and Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the second.</p>

<p>The whole Strength of the Argument is contained in the Apostle’s
Words before-mentioned; which therefore being granted, I shall
proceed to deduce a second Argument, thus:</p>

<p>That which is Spiritual can only be known and discerned by the
Spirit of God.</p>

<p>But the Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the true and saving Knowledge
of him, is Spiritual:</p>

<p>Therefore the Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the true and saving
Knowledge of him, can only be known and discerned by the Spirit
of God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof II.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>No Man can call Jesus Lord</i>, &amp;c.</span>
The other Scripture is also a Saying of the same Apostle, 1 Cor.
xii. 3. <i>No Man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</i> This
Scripture, which is full of Truth, and answereth full well to the enlightened
Understanding of the spiritual and real Christian, may perhaps
prove very strange to the carnal and pretended Follower of
Christ, by whom perhaps it hath not been so diligently remarked.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Spiritual Truths are Lies spoken by Carnal Men.</i></span>Here the Apostle doth so much require the Holy Spirit, in the Things
that relate to a Christian, that he positively avers, we cannot so much
as affirm <i>Jesus to be the Lord without it</i>; which insinuates no less, than
that the Spiritual Truths of the Gospel are as Lies in the Mouths of
carnal and unspiritual Men; for tho’ in themselves they be true, yet
are they not true as to them, because not known, nor uttered forth,
in and by that Principle and Spirit that ought to direct the Mind,
and actuate it; in such Things they are no better than the counterfeit
Representations of Things in a Comedy; neither can it be more truly
and properly called a real and true Knowledge of God and Christ,
than the Actions of <i>Alexander</i> the Great, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, &amp;c. if now
transacted upon a Stage, might be called truly and really their Doings,
or the Persons representing them might be said truly and really
to have conquered <i>Asia</i>, overcome <i>Pompey</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Like the Pratling of a Parrot.</i></span>This Knowledge then of Christ, which is not by the Revelation
of his own Spirit in the Heart, is no more properly the Knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
of Christ, than the Pratling of a <i>Parrot</i>, which has been taught a few
Words, may be said to be the Voice of a Man; for as that, or some
other Bird, may be taught to sound or utter forth a rational Sentence,
as it hath learned it by the outward Ear, and not from any
living Principle of Reason actuating it; so just such is that Knowledge
of the Things of God, which the natural and carnal Man hath
gathered from the Words or Writings of Spiritual Men; which are
not true to him, because conceived in the natural Spirit, and so
brought forth by the wrong Organ, and not proceeding from the
Spiritual Principle; no more than the Words of a Man, acquired by
Art, and brought forth by the Mouth of a Bird, not proceeding
from a Rational Principle, are true, with respect to the Bird which
utters them. Wherefore from this Scripture I shall further add
this Argument:</p>

<p>If no Man can say <i>Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost</i>; then no
Man can know <i>Jesus to be the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost</i>.</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore the second.</p>

<p>From this Argument there may be another deduced, concluding
in the very Terms of this Assertion: Thus,</p>

<p>If no Man can know <i>Jesus to be the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost</i>; then
can there be no certain Knowledge or Revelation of him, but by the
Spirit.</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore the second.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Assert. </i>III.<i> Proved.</i></span>The third Thing affirmed is, <i>That by the Spirit God always
revealed himself to his Children</i>.</div>

<p>For making the Truth of this Assertion appear, it will be but
needful to consider God’s manifesting himself towards, and in relation
to his Creatures, from the Beginning, which resolves itself
always herein. The first Step of all is ascribed hereunto by <i>Moses</i>,
Gen. i. 2. <i>And the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Revelation is by the Spirit of God.</i></span>I think it will not be denied, that God’s Converse with Man, all along
from <i>Adam to Moses</i>, was by the Immediate Manifestation of his Spirit:
And afterwards, through the whole Tract of the Law, he spake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
his Children no otherways; which, as it naturally followeth from
the Principles above proved, so it cannot be denied, by such as acknowledge
the Scriptures of Truth to have been written by the Inspiration
of the Holy Ghost: For these Writings, from <i>Moses</i> to <i>Malachi</i>,
do declare, that during all that Time, God revealed himself to
his Children by his Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if any will Object, <i>That after the Dispensation of the Law, God’s
Method of Speaking was altered</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>Sanctum Sanctorum.</i></span>
I answer: <i>First</i>, That God spake always immediately to the <i>Jews</i>,
in that he spake always immediately to the <i>High-Priest</i> from betwixt
the <i>Cherubims</i>; who, when he entered into the <i>Holy of Holies</i>, returning,
did relate to the whole People the Voice and Will of God, there
immediately Revealed. So that this immediate Speaking never
ceased in any Age.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>None shut out from this Immediate Fellowship.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, From this immediate Fellowship were none shut out, who
earnestly sought after, and waited for it; in that many, besides the
<i>High-Priest</i>, who were not so much as of the Kindred of <i>Levi</i>, nor of
the Prophets, did receive it and speak from it; as it is written,
<i>Numb.</i> xi. 25. where the <i>Spirit</i> is said to have <i>rested upon the Seventy
Elders</i>; which Spirit also reached unto two that were not in the Tabernacle,
but in the Camp; whom when some would have forbidden,
<i>Moses</i> would not, but rejoiced, <i>wishing that all the Lord’s People
were Prophets, and that he would put his Spirit upon them</i>, Ver. 29.</p>

<p>This is also confirmed, <i>Neh.</i> ix. Where the Elders of the People,
after their Return from Captivity, when they began to sanctify
themselves by Fasting and Prayer, numbering up the many Mercies
of God towards their Fathers, say, Ver. 20. <i>Thou gavest also
thy good Spirit to instruct them</i>; and Ver. 30. <i>Yet many Years didst thou
forbear, and testify against them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets.</i> Many are
the Sayings of Spiritual <i>David</i> to this Purpose, as <i>Psalm</i> li. 11, 12.
<i>Take not thy holy Spirit from me; uphold me with thy free Spirit.</i> Psal. cxxxix.
7. <i>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?</i> Hereunto doth the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>
ascribe the Credit of his Testimony, saying, Chap. xlviii. 16. <i>And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me.</i> And that God revealed himself
to his Children under the New Testament, <i>to wit</i>, to the Apostles,
Evangelists, and Primitive Disciples, is confessed by all. How far
now this yet continueth, and is to be expected, comes hereafter to
be spoken to.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assert.</i> IV.</span>The fourth thing affirmed is, <i>That these Revelations were
the Object of the Saints’ Faith of old</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>This will easily appear by the Definition of Faith, and considering
what its Object is: For which we shall not dive into the curious and
various Notions of the School-men, but stay in the plain and positive
Words of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, who, <i>Heb.</i> xi. describes it two Ways.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What Faith is?</i></span><i>Faith </i>(saith he)<i> is the Substance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of
Things not seen</i>: Which, as the Apostle illustrateth it in the same Chapter
by many Examples, is no other but a firm and certain Belief of
the Mind, whereby it <i>resteth</i>, and in a Sense <i>possesseth</i> the Substance
of some Things hoped for, through its Confidence in the Promise of
God: And thus the Soul hath a most firm Evidence, by its Faith,
of Things not yet seen nor come to pass. The Object of this Faith,
is the <i>Promise</i>, <i>Word</i>, or <i>Testimony of God</i>, speaking in the Mind.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Object of Faith</i>, Deus Loquens.</span>Hence
it hath been generally affirmed, That the Object of Faith is <i>Deus
Loquens</i>, &amp;c. that is, <i>God Speaking</i>, &amp;c. Which is also manifest from
all those Examples, deduced by the Apostle throughout that whole
Chapter, whose Faith was founded neither upon any outward Testimony,
nor upon the Voice or Writing of Man, but upon the Revelation
of God’s Will, manifest unto them, and in them; as in the
Example of <i>Noah</i>, Ver. 7, thus, <i>By Faith </i>Noah<i> being warned of God, of
Things not seen as yet, moved with Fear, prepared an Ark to the saving of his
House; by the which he condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteousness
which is by Faith</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Noah’s <i>Faith</i>.</span>What was here the Object of <i>Noah’s Faith</i>,
but God speaking unto him? He had not the Writings nor Prophesyings
of any going before, nor yet the Concurrence of any Church
or People, to strengthen him; and yet his Faith in the Word, by
which he contradicted the whole World, saved him and his House.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
<span class="sidenote">Abraham’s <i>Faith</i>.</span>Of which also <i>Abraham</i> is set forth as a singular Example, being therefore
called the Father of the Faithful, who is said <i>against Hope to have
believed in Hope</i>; in that he not only willingly forsook his Father’s
Country, not knowing whither he went; in that he believed concerning
the coming of <i>Isaac</i>, though contrary to natural Probability;
but above all, in that he refused not to offer him up, not doubting
but God was able to raise him from the Dead; of whom it is said,
That in <i>Isaac shall thy Seed be called</i>. And last of all, In that he rested
in the Promise, that his Seed should possess the Land, wherein he
himself was but a Pilgrim, and which to them was not to be fulfilled
while divers Ages after. The Object of <i>Abraham’s</i> Faith in all this,
was no other but inward and immediate Revelation, or God signifying
his Will unto him inwardly and immediately by his Spirit.</p>

<p>But because, in this Part of the Proposition, we made also Mention
of external Voices, Appearances, and Dreams in the Alternative,
I think also fit to speak hereof what in that respect may be
objected; to wit,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>That those who found their Faith now upon Immediate and Objective Revelation,
ought to have also outward Voices or Visions, Dreams or Appearances
for it.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Answ.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Ministry of Angels speaking in the Appearance of Men to the Saints of old.</i></span>
It is not denied, but God made use of the Ministry of Angels,
who, in the Appearance of Men, spake outwardly to the Saints of
old, and that he did also reveal some Things to them in Dreams and
Visions; none of which we will affirm to be ceased, so as to limit
the Power and Liberty of God, in manifesting himself towards his
Children. But while we are considering the Object of Faith, we
must not stick to that which is but Circumstantially and Accidentally
so, but to that which is Universally and Substantially so.</p>

<p>Next again, We must distinguish betwixt that which in itself is
subject to Doubt and Delusion, and therefore is received for and
because of another; and that which is not subject to any Doubt, but
is received simply for and because of itself, as being <i>Prima Veritas</i>,
the <i>very First</i> and <i>Original</i> Truth. Let us then consider how, or how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
far, these outward Voices, Appearances and Dreams, were the Object
of the Saints’ Faith: Was it because they were simply Voices, Appearances
or Dreams?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Revelations by Dreams and Visions.</i></span>Nay certainly; for they were not ignorant
that the Devil might form a Sound of Words, convey it to the
outward Ear, and deceive the outward Senses, by making Things
to appear that are not. Yea, do we not see by daily Experience,
that the <i>jugglers</i> and <i>Mountebanks</i> can do as much as all
that, by their <i>Legerdemain</i>? God forbid then, that the Saints’ Faith
should be founded upon so fallacious a Foundation, as Man’s outward
and fallible Senses. What made them then give Credit to
these Visions? Certainly nothing else, but the secret Testimony of
<i>God’s Spirit</i> in their Hearts, assuring them that the Voices, Dreams
and Visions, were of and from God. <i>Abraham</i> believed the Angels;
but who told him that these Men were Angels? We must not think
his Faith then was built upon his outward Senses; but proceeded
from the secret Persuasion of God’s Spirit in his Heart. This then
must needs be acknowledged to be originally and principally the
Object of the Saints’ Faith; without which there is no true and certain
Faith, and by which many Times Faith is begotten and strengthened,
without any of these outward or visible Helps; as we may
observe in many Passages of the Holy Scripture, where it is only
mentioned, <i>And God said</i>, &amp;c. And <i>the Word of the Lord came</i> unto
such and such, <i>saying</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if any one should pertinaciously affirm, <i>That this did import an
outward audible Voice to the Carnal Ear</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I would gladly know, what other Argument such an one could
bring for this his Affirmation, saving his own simple Conjecture. It
is said indeed, <i>The Spirit witnesseth with our Spirit</i>; but not to our outward
Ears, <i>Rom.</i> viii. 16. And seeing the Spirit of God is within
us, and not without us only, it speaks to our spiritual, and not to
our bodily Ear.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Spirit speaks to the Spiritual Ear, not to the Outward.</i></span>Therefore I see no Reason, where it is so often said
in Scripture, <i>The Spirit said</i>, <i>moved</i>, <i>hindered</i>, <i>called</i> such or such a one,
to <i>do</i> or <i>forbear</i> such or such a Thing, that any have to conclude that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
this was not an Inward Voice to the Ear of the Soul, rather than an
Outward Voice to the Bodily Ear. If any be otherwise minded, let
them, if they can, produce their Arguments, and we may further
consider of them.</p>

<p>From all therefore which is above declared, I shall deduce an Argument,
to conclude the Proof of this Assertion, thus:</p>

<p>That which any one firmly believes, as the Ground and Foundation
of his Hope in God, and Life Eternal, is the formal Object of
his Faith.</p>

<p>But the inward and immediate Revelation of God’s Spirit, speaking
in and unto the Saints, was by them believed, as the Ground
and Foundation of their Hope in God, and Life Eternal.</p>

<p>Therefore these inward and immediate Revelations were the formal
Object of their Faith.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assert. </i>V.<i> Proved.</i></span>That which now cometh under Debate, is, what we asserted
in the last Place, to wit, <i>That the same continueth to be the Object of the
Saints’ Faith unto this Day</i>. Many will agree to what we have said before,
who differ from us herein.</div>

<p>There is nevertheless a very firm Argument confirming the Truth
of this Assertion, included in the Proposition itself, to wit, <i>That the
Object of the Saints’ Faith is the same in all Ages, though held forth under divers
Administrations</i>. Which I shall reduce to an Argument, and prove,
thus:</p>

<p>First, <i>Where the Faith is one, the Object of the Faith is one</i>.</p>

<p><i>But the Faith is one: Therefore</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>That the Faith is one, is the express Words of the Apostle, <i>Eph.</i> iv.
5. who placeth the <i>one Faith</i> with the <i>one God</i>; importing no less than,
that to affirm <i>two Faiths</i>, is as absurd as to affirm <i>two Gods</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Faith of the Saints of old the same with ours.</i></span>Moreover, if the <i>Faith</i> of the Ancients were not one and the same
with ours, <i>i. e.</i> agreeing in <i>Substance</i> therewith, and receiving the
same Definition, it had been impertinent for the Apostle, <i>Heb.</i> xi. to
have illustrated the Definition of our Faith, by the Examples of that
of the Ancients, or to go about to move us by the Example of <i>Abraham</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
if <i>Abraham</i>’s Faith were different in Nature from ours. Nor doth
any Difference arise hence, because they believed in Christ, with respect
to his Appearance outwardly as future; and we, as already appeared:
For neither did they then so believe in him to come, as not
to feel him present with them, and witness him near; seeing the
Apostle saith, <i>They all drank of that spiritual Rock which followed them,
which Rock was Christ</i>. Nor do we so believe concerning his Appearance
past, as not also to feel and know him <i>present with us</i>, and to <i>feed
upon him</i>; <i>except Christ </i>(saith the Apostle)<i> be in you, ye are Reprobates</i>; so
that both our Faith is one, terminating in one and the same Thing.
And as to the other Part or Consequence of the Antecedent; to wit,
<i>That the Object is one, where the Faith is one</i>; the Apostle also proveth it
in the fore-cited Chapter, where he makes all the Worthies of old Examples
to us. Now wherein are they imitable, but because they believed
in God? And what was the Object of their Faith, but inward
and immediate Revelation, as we have before proved? Their Example
can be no-ways applicable to us, except we believe in God as
they did; that is, by the same Object. The Apostle clears this yet
further by his own Example, <i>Gal.</i> i. 16. where he saith, <i>So soon as
Christ was revealed in him, he consulted not with Flesh and Blood, but forthwith
believed and obeyed</i>. The same Apostle, <i>Heb.</i> xiii. 7, 8. where he
exhorteth the <i>Hebrews</i> to follow the Faith of the Elders, adds this
Reason, <i>Considering the End of their Conversation, Jesus Christ, the same To-day,
Yesterday, and for ever</i>: Hereby notably insinuating, that in the Object there is no Alteration.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If any now object the <i>Diversity of Administration</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; That altereth not at all the <i>Object</i>: For the same Apostle
mentioning this Diversity three Times, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. 4, 5, 6. centereth
always in the same Object; the same Spirit, the same Lord, the same
God.</p>

<p>But further; If the Object of Faith were not one and the same,
both to us and to them, then it would follow that we were to know
God some other Way than by the Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>But this were absurd: Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Lastly, This is most firmly proved from a common and received
Maxim of the School-men, to wit, <i>Omnis actus specificatur ab objecto</i>,
Every Act is specified from its Object: for which if it be true, as they
acknowledge; (though for the Sake of many, I shall not recur to
this Argument, as being too Nice and Scholastick; neither lay I
much Stress upon those Kind of Things, as being that which commends
not the Simplicity of the Gospel) it would follow, that <i>If the
Object were different, then the Faith would be different also</i>.</p>

<p>Such as deny this Proposition now-a-days, use here a Distinction;
granting that <i>God is to be known by his Spirit</i>; but again denying that
<i>it is Immediate or Inward, but in and by the Scriptures, in which the Mind of
the Spirit </i>(as they say)<i> being fully and amply Expressed, we are thereby to
know God, and be led in all Things</i>.</p>

<p>As to the Negative of this Assertion, That the Scriptures are not
sufficient, neither were ever appointed to be the adequate and only
Rule, nor yet can guide or direct a Christian in all those Things
that are needful for him to know, we shall leave that to the next
Proposition to be examined.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christians are now to be led by the Spirit, in the same Manner as the Saints of Old.</i></span>What is proper in this Place to be
proved, is, <i>That Christians now are to be led inwardly and immediately by
the Spirit of God</i>, even in the same Manner (though it befal not
many to be led in the same Measure) as the Saints were of old.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3> I shall prove this by divers Arguments, and first from the
Promise of Christ in these Words, <i>John</i> xiv. 16. <i>And I will pray the Father,
and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for
ever.</i> Ver. 17. <i>Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive,
because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth
with you, and shall be in you.</i> Again, Ver. 26. <i>But the Comforter,
which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my Name, he shall teach
you all Things, and bring all Things to your Remembrance</i>; and xvi. 13. <i>But
when the Spirit of Truth shall come, he shall lead you into all Truth: For he
shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, he shall speak, and
shall declare unto you Things to come</i>. We have here first, who this is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
and that is divers Ways expressed, to wit, <i>The Comforter</i>, <i>the Spirit of
Truth</i>, <i>the Holy Ghost</i>, <i>the Sent of the Father in the Name of Christ</i>. And
hereby is sufficiently proved the Sottishness of those <i>Socinians</i>, and
other carnal Christians, who neither know nor acknowledge any Internal
Spirit or Power but that which is merely Natural, by which
they sufficiently declare themselves to be of the World, who cannot
receive the Spirit, because they neither see him nor know him. <i>Secondly</i>,
Where this Spirit is to be, <i>He dwelleth with you, and shall be in
you</i>. And <i>Thirdly</i>, What his Work is, <i>He shall teach you all Things, and
bring all Things to your Remembrance, and guide you <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: in">into</span> all Truth</i>, [Greek: hodêgêsei
hymas eis pasan tên alêtheian: ὁδηγησει ὑμας εις πασαν την αληθειαν].</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Query </i>I<i>. Who is this Comforter?</i></span>As to the <i>First</i>, Most do acknowledge that there is nothing else
understood than what the plain Words signify: which is also evident
by many other Places of Scripture, that will hereafter occur;
neither do I see how such as affirm otherways can avoid Blasphemy:
For, if the <i>Comforter</i>, the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, and <i>Spirit of Truth</i>, be all
one with the Scriptures, then it will follow that the Scriptures are
God, seeing it is true that the Holy Ghost is God.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Nonsensical Consequences from the</i> Socinians <i>Belief of the Scriptures being the Spirit.</i></span>If these Men’s
Reasoning might take Place, wherever the <i>Spirit</i> is mentioned in relation
to the Saints, thereby might be truly and properly understood
the <i>Scriptures</i>: which, what a nonsensical Monster it would make of
the Christian Religion, will easily appear to all Men. As where it is
said, <i>A Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal</i>; it
might be rendered thus, A Manifestation of the <i>Scriptures</i> is given to
every Man to profit withal; what notable Sense this would make,
and what a curious Interpretation; let us consider by the Sequel of
the same Chapter, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. 9, 10, 11. <i>To another the Gifts of Healing, by
the same Spirit; to another, the working of Miracles, </i>&amp;c.<i> But all these worketh
that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every Man severally as he will.</i>
What would now these great Masters of Reason, the <i>Socinians</i>, judge,
if we should place the <i>Scriptures</i> here instead of the <i>Spirit</i>? Would it
answer their Reason, which is the great Guide of their Faith? Would
it be good and sound Reason in their <i>Logical Schools</i>, to affirm that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
the Scripture divideth severally, as it will, and giveth to some the
<i>Gift of Healing, to others the working of Miracles</i>? If then this Spirit, a
Manifestation whereof is given to every Man to profit withal, be no
other than that <i>Spirit of Truth</i>, before-mentioned, <i>which guideth into all
Truth</i>; this Spirit of Truth cannot be the Scripture. I could infer
an Hundred more Absurdities of this Kind, upon this sottish Opinion;
but what is said may suffice. For even some of themselves, being at
Times forgetful, or ashamed of their own Doctrine, do acknowledge,
that the Spirit of God is another Thing, and distinct from the Scriptures,
to Guide and Influence the Saints.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Query </i>II<i>. Where is his Place?</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, That this Spirit is inward, in my Opinion, needs no Interpretation,
or Commentary, <i>He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you</i>.
This Indwelling of the Spirit in the Saints, as it is a Thing most needful
to be known and believed; so is it as positively asserted in the
Scripture, as any Thing else can be. <i>If so be that the Spirit of God dwell
in you</i>, saith the Apostle to the <i>Romans</i>, Chap. viii. 9. And again,
<i>Know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 19.
<i>And that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i> 1 Cor. iii. 16. Without this
the Apostle reckoneth no Man a Christian. <i>If any Man </i>(saith he)<i>
have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</i> These Words immediately
follow these above-mentioned, out of the Epistle to the <i>Romans</i>, <i>But
ye are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in
you</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Spirit within, the main Token of a Christian.</i></span>The Context of which sheweth, that the Apostle reckoneth it
the main Token of a Christian, both positively and negatively: For
in the former Verses, he sheweth how the <i>carnal Mind is Enmity against
God</i>, and that such as are in the <i>Flesh</i>, <i>cannot please him</i>. Where subsuming,
he adds concerning the <i>Romans</i>, that they <i>are not in the Flesh</i>,
if the <i>Spirit of God dwell in them</i>. What is this but to affirm, that they,
in whom the Spirit dwells, are no longer in the Flesh, nor of those
who please not God, but are become Christians indeed? Again, in
the next Verse he concludes negatively, that <i>If any Man have not the
Spirit of Christ, he is none of his</i>; that is, he is no Christian. He then
that acknowledges himself Ignorant, and a Stranger to the Inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
In-being of the Spirit of Christ in his Heart, doth thereby acknowledge
himself to be yet in the Carnal Mind, which is Enmity to God;
to be yet in the Flesh, where God cannot be pleased; and in short,
whatever he may otherways know or believe of Christ, or however
much skilled, or acquainted with the Letter of the Holy Scripture,
not yet to be, notwithstanding all that, attained to the least Degree
of a Christian; yea, not once to have embraced the Christian Religion.
For take but away the Spirit, and Christianity remains no
more Christianity, than the dead Carcase of a Man, when the Soul
and Spirit is departed, remains a Man; which the living can no
more abide, but do bury out of their Sight as a noisome and useless
Thing, however acceptable it hath been, when actuated and moved
by the Soul. Lastly, <i>Whatsoever is Excellent, whatsoever is Noble, whatsoever
is Worthy, whatsoever is Desirable</i> in the Christian Faith, is ascribed
to this <i>Spirit</i>; without which it could no more subsist, than the outward
World without the Sun. Hereunto have all true Christians,
in all Ages, attributed their Strength and Life. It is by this Spirit,
that they avouch themselves to have been converted to God, to have
been redeemed from the World, to have been strengthened in their
Weakness, comforted in their Afflictions, confirmed in their Temptations,
imboldened in their Sufferings, and triumphed in the Midst
of all their Persecutions.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The great and notable Acts that have been and are performed by the Spirit in all Ages.</i></span>Yea, The Writings of all true Christians
are full of the great and notable Things, which they all affirm themselves
to have done, by the Power, and Virtue, and Efficacy of this
Spirit of God working in them. <i>It is the Spirit that quickeneth</i>, <i>John</i>
vi. 63. It was the <i>Spirit that gave them Utterance</i>, <i>Acts</i> ii. 4. It was
the <i>Spirit</i> by which <i>Stephen</i> spake, <i>That the Jews were not able to resist</i>,
Acts vi. 10. It is such as <i>walk after the Spirit, that receive no Condemnation</i>,
Rom. viii. 1. It is the <i>Law of the Spirit that makes free</i>, Ver. 2. It
is by the <i>Spirit of God dwelling in us</i>, that we are <i>redeemed from the Flesh,
and from the Carnal Mind</i>, Ver. 9. It is <i>the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us,
that quickeneth our mortal Bodies</i>, Ver. 11. It is through this <i>Spirit</i>, that
the Deeds of the Body are <i>mortified</i>, and Life obtained, Ver. 13. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
by this <i>Spirit</i>, that we are <i>adopted</i>, and <i>cry ABBA Father</i>, Ver 15. It
is this <i>Spirit</i>, <i>that beareth Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of
God</i>, Ver. 16. It is this <i>Spirit</i>, <i>that helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Intercession
for us, with Groanings which cannot be uttered</i>, Ver. 26. It is by
this <i>Spirit</i>, that the glorious Things which God hath laid up for us,
<i>which neither outward Ear hath heard, nor outward Eye hath seen, nor the
Heart of Man conceived</i> by all his Reasonings, are revealed unto us,
1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. 9, 10. It is by this <i>Spirit</i>, that both <i>Wisdom</i>, and <i>Knowledge</i>,
and <i>Faith</i>, and <i>Miracles</i>, and <i>Tongues</i>, and <i>Prophecies</i>, are obtained,
1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. 8, 9, 10. It is by this <i>Spirit</i>, that we are <i>all Baptized into
one Body</i>, Ver. 13. In short, what Thing relating to the Salvation of
the Soul, and to the Life of a Christian, is rightly performed, or effectually
obtained, without it? And what shall I say more? For the
Time would fail me, to tell of all those Things, which the Holy
Men of Old have declared, and the Saints of this Day do themselves
enjoy, by the Virtue and Power of this <i>Spirit dwelling in them</i>.
Truly my Paper could not contain the many Testimonies, whereby
this Truth is confirmed; wherefore, besides what is above-mentioned
out of the Fathers, whom all pretend to Reverence, and those of
<i>Luther</i> and <i>Melancthon</i>, shall deduce yet one observable Testimony
out of <i>Calvin</i>, because not a few of the Followers of his Doctrine do
refuse and deride (and that, as it is to be feared, because of their own
Non-experience thereof) this Way of the Spirit’s In-dwelling, as uncertain
and dangerous; that so, if neither the Testimony of the
Scripture, nor the Sayings of others, nor right Reason can move
them, they may at least be reproved by the Words of their own Master,
who saith in the third Book of his Institutions, <i>Cap.</i> 2. on this
wise:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Calvin of the Necessity of the Spirit’s Indwelling in us.</i></span>“<i>But they alledge, it is a bold Presumption for any to pretend to an undoubted
Knowledge of God’s Will</i>; which (saith he) I should grant unto
them, if we should ascribe so much to ourselves, as to subject the
Incomprehensible Counsel of God to the Rashness of our Understandings.
But while we simply say, with <i>Paul</i>, that <i>we have received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
not the Spirit of this World, but the Spirit which is of God</i>; by whose
Teaching we know those Things that are given us of God, what
can they prate against it, without reproaching the Spirit of God?
For if it be an horrible Sacrilege to accuse any Revelation coming
from him, either of a Lie, of Uncertainty or Ambiguity, in asserting
its Certainty, wherein do we offend? But they cry out, <i>That
it is not without great Temerity, that we dare so boast of the Spirit of Christ</i>.
Who would believe that the Sottishness of these Men were so great,
who would be esteemed the Masters of the World, that they should
so fail in the first Principles of Religion? Verily I could not believe
it, if their own Writings did not testify so much. <i>Paul</i> accounts
those the <i>Sons of God, who are actuated by the Spirit of God</i>; but
these will have the Children of God actuated by their own Spirits,
without the Spirit of God. He will have us call God <i>Father</i>, the
Spirit dictating that Term unto us, which only can witness to our
Spirits, that we are the <i>Sons of God</i>. These, though they cease not
to call upon God, do nevertheless dismiss the Spirit, by whose guiding
he is rightly to be called upon. He denies them to be the
<i>Sons of God</i>, or the <i>Servants of Christ</i>, who are not led by his Spirit;
but these feign a Christianity that needs not the Spirit of Christ.
He takes away the Hope of a blessed <i>Resurrection</i>, unless we feel the
Spirit residing in us; but these feign a Hope without any such a
Feeling; but perhaps they will answer, that they deny not but that
it is necessary to have it, only of Modesty and Humility we ought
to deny and not acknowledge it. What means he then, when he
commands the <i>Corinthians</i> to <i>Try themselves</i>, if they be in the Faith;
to <i>Examine themselves</i>, whether they have Christ, whom whosoever
acknowledges not dwelling in him, is a Reprobate? <i>By the Spirit
which he hath given us, </i>saith<i> John, we know that he abideth in us.</i> And
what do we then else but call in question Christ’s Promise, while
we would be esteemed the Servants of God, without his Spirit,
which he declared he would <i>pour out upon all his</i>? Seeing these Things
are the first Grounds of Piety, it is miserable Blindness to accuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
Christians of Pride, because they dare glory of the Presence of the
Spirit; without which glorying, Christianity itself could not be.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Without the Spirit’s Presence </i>Christianity<i> must cease.</i></span>But by their Example they declare, how truly Christ spake, saying,
That his Spirit was unknown to the World, and that those only
acknowledge it, with whom it remains.” Thus far <i>Calvin</i>.</p>

<p>If therefore it be so, Why should any be so foolish as to deny, or
so unwise as not to seek after this Spirit, which Christ hath promised
shall dwell in his Children? They then that do suppose the
Indwelling and Leading of his Spirit to be ceased, must also suppose
Christianity to be ceased, which cannot subsist without it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Query </i>III<i>. What is the Work of the Spirit?</i></span>Thirdly, <i>What the Work of this Spirit is</i>, is partly before shewn, which
Christ compriseth in two or three Things, <a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><i>He will guide you into all Truth</i>;
<i>He will teach you all Things, and bring all Things to your Remembrance</i>. Since
Christ hath provided for us so good an Instructor, why need we
then lean so much to those Traditions and Commandments of Men,
wherewith so many <i>Christians</i> have burthened themselves? Why need
we set up our own carnal and corrupt Reason for a Guide to us, in
Matters spiritual, as some will needs do?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Spirit the Guide.</i></span>May it not be complained
of all such, as the Lord did of old, concerning <i>Israel</i>, by the Prophets,
<i>Jer.</i> ii. 13. <i>For my People have committed two Evils, they have forsaken
me, the Fountain of Living Waters; and hewed them out Cisterns, broken
Cisterns, that can hold no Water?</i> Have not many forsaken, do not
many deride and reject, this Inward and Immediate Guide, this Spirit,
that leads into all Truth; and cast up to themselves other Ways,
broken Ways indeed, which have not all this While brought them
out of the Flesh, nor out of the World, nor from under the Dominion
of their own Lusts and sinful Affections; whereby Truth,
which is only rightly learned by this Spirit, is so much a Stranger
in the Earth?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>A perpetual Ordinance to </i>God<i>’s Church and People.</i></span><span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: For">From</span> all then that hath been mentioned concerning this Promise,
and these Words of Christ, it will follow, That Christians are always
to be led inwardly and immediately by the Spirit of God dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
in them; and that the same is a standing and perpetual Ordinance,
as well to the Church in general in all Ages, as to every Individual
Member in particular; as appears from this Argument:</p>

<p>The <i>Promises</i> of Christ to his Children are <i>Yea</i> and <i>Amen</i>, and cannot
fail, but must of Necessity be fulfilled.</p>

<p>But Christ hath promised, That the <i>Comforter</i>, the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, the
<i>Spirit of Truth</i>, shall abide with his Children for ever, shall dwell with
them, shall be in them, shall lead them into all Truth, shall teach
them all Things, and bring all Things to their Remembrance:</p>

<p>Therefore, The <i>Comforter</i>, the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, the <i>Spirit of Truth</i>, his abiding
with his Children, <i>&amp;c.</i> is <i>Yea</i> and <i>Amen</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Again: No Man is redeemed from the Carnal Mind, which is at
Enmity with God, which is not subject to the Law of God, neither
can be; no Man is yet in the Spirit, but in the Flesh, and cannot
please God; except he in whom the Spirit of God dwells.</p>

<p>But every true Christian is in measure redeemed from the Carnal
Mind, is gathered out of the Enmity, and can be subject to the Law
of God; is out of the Flesh, and in the Spirit, the Spirit of God
dwelling in him:</p>

<p>Therefore every true Christian hath the Spirit of God dwelling in
him.</p>

<p>Again: <i>Whosoever hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his</i>; that is, no
<i>Child</i>, no <i>Friend</i>, no <i>Disciple</i> of Christ.</p>

<p>But every true Christian is a <i>Child</i>, a <i>Friend</i>, a <i>Disciple</i> of Christ:</p>

<p>Therefore every true Christian hath the Spirit of Christ.</p>

<p>Moreover: Whosoever is the Temple of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, in him the
Spirit of God dwelleth and abideth.</p>

<p>But every true Christian is the Temple of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore in every true Christian the Spirit of God dwelleth and
abideth.</p>

<p>But to conclude: He in whom the Spirit of God dwelleth, it is
not in him a lazy, dumb, useless Thing; but it moveth, actuateth, go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>verneth,
instructeth, and teacheth him all Things, whatsoever are needful
for him to know; yea, bringeth all Things to his Remembrance.</p>

<p>But the Spirit of God dwelleth in every true Christian:</p>

<p>Therefore the Spirit of God leadeth, instructeth, and teacheth
every true Christian whatsoever is needful for him to know.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But there are some that will confess, <i>That the Spirit doth now
lead and influence the Saints, but that he doth it only Subjectively, or in a blind
Manner, by enlightening their Understandings, to understand and believe the Truth
delivered in the Scriptures; but not at all by presenting those Truths to the Mind,
by Way of Object</i>, and this they call, <i>Medium incognitum Assentiendi</i>, as that
<i>of whose working a Man is not sensible</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This Opinion, though somewhat more tolerable than the former,
is nevertheless not altogether according to Truth, neither doth it
reach the Fulness of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg 1.</i></span>1. Because there be many Truths, which, as they are applicable to
Particulars and Individuals, and most needful to be known by them,
are in no-wise to be found in the Scripture, as in the following <i>Proposition</i>
shall be shewn.</p>

<p>Besides, the <i>Arguments</i> already adduced do prove, that the Spirit
doth not only <i>Subjectively</i> help us to discern Truths elsewhere delivered,
but also <i>Objectively</i> present those Truths to our Minds. For that which
teacheth me all Things, and is given me for that End, without doubt
presents those Things to my Mind which it teacheth me. It is not
said, <i>It shall teach you how to understand those Things that are written</i>; but,
<i>It shall teach you all Things</i>. Again, that which brings all Things to my
Remembrance, must needs present them by Way of Object; else it
were improper to say, It brought them to my Remembrance; but
only, that it helpeth to remember the Objects brought from elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 2.</i></span>My second Argument shall be drawn from the Nature of the <i>New
Covenant</i>; by which, and those that follow, I shall prove that we are
led by the Spirit, both <i>Immediately</i> and <i>Objectively</i>. The Nature of the
New Covenant is expressed in divers Places: And</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 1.</i></span>First, <i>Isa.</i> lix. 21. <i>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord, My
Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words which I have put into thy Mouth, shall not
depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth
of thy Seed’s Seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Leadings of the Spirit.</i></span>By the latter
Part of this is sufficiently expressed the Perpetuity and Continuance
of this Promise, <i>It shall not depart, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for
ever</i>. In the former Part is the Promise itself, which is the Spirit of
God being upon them, and the Words of God being put into their
Mouths.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1. Immediately.</span>First, This was <i>Immediate</i>, for there is no Mention made of any <i>Medium</i>;
he saith not, I shall by the Means of such and such Writings
or Books, convey such and such Words into your Mouths; but <i>My
Words, I, even I, saith the Lord, have put into your Mouths</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">2. Objectively.</span>Secondly, This must be <i>Objectively</i>; for [<i>the Words put into the Mouth</i>]
are the Object presented by him. He saith not, The Words which ye
shall see written, my Spirit shall only enlighten your Understandings
to assent unto; but positively, <i>My Words, which I have put into thy
Mouth</i>, &amp;c. From whence I Argue thus:</p>

<p>Upon whomsoever the Spirit remaineth always, and putteth Words
into his Mouth, him doth the Spirit teach <i>Immediately</i>, <i>Objectively</i>, and
<i>Continually</i>.</p>

<p>But the Spirit is always upon the Seed of the Righteous, and putteth
Words into their Mouths, neither departeth from them:</p>

<p>Therefore the Spirit teacheth the Righteous <i>Immediately</i>, <i>Objectively</i>,
and <i>Continually</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 2.</i></span>Secondly, The Nature of the <i>New Covenant</i> is yet more amply expressed,
<i>Jer.</i> xxxi. 33. which is again repeated and re-asserted, by the
Apostle, <i>Heb.</i> viii. 10, 11. in these Words, <i>For this is the Covenant that I
will make with the House of Israel, after those Days, saith the Lord, I will put
my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts, and I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to me a People. And they shall not teach every Man
his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they
shall all know me from the least to the greatest.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The Object here is <i>God’s Law</i> placed in the Heart, and written in
the Mind; from whence they become God’s People, and are brought
truly to know him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Difference between the Outward and Inward Law. </i></span>In this then is the <i>Law</i> distinguished from the <i>Gospel</i>; the <i>Law</i> before
was outward, written in Tables of Stone; but now is inward,
written in the Heart: Of old the People depended upon their Priests for
the Knowledge of God, but now they have all a certain and sensible
Knowledge of Him; concerning which <i>Augustine</i> speaketh well, in
his Book <i>De Litera &amp; Spiritu</i>; from whom <i>Aquinas</i> first of all seems to
have taken Occasion to move this Question, <i>Whether the New Law be a
written Law, or an Implanted Law; Lex scripta, vel Lex indita?</i> Which he
thus resolves, Affirming, <i>That the New Law, or Gospel, is not properly a
Law written, as the Old was, but </i>Lex indita<i>, an Implanted Law</i>; and
that <i>the old Law was written without, but the new Law is written within, on
the Table of the Heart</i>.</p>

<p>How much then are they deceived, who, instead of making the
Gospel preferable to the Law, have made the Condition of such as
are under the Gospel far worse?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Gospel Dispensation more glorious than that of the Law.</i></span>For no Doubt it is a far better, and
more desirable Thing, to converse with God <i>Immediately</i>, than only <i>Mediately</i>,
as being an higher and more glorious Dispensation: And yet
these Men acknowledge, that many under the Law had <i>Immediate</i>
Converse with God, whereas they now cry it is ceased.</p>

<p>Again, Under the Law, there was the Holy of Holies, into which
the High Priest did enter, and received the Word of the Lord <i>immediately</i>
from betwixt the Cherubims, so that the People could then
certainly know the Mind of the Lord; but now, according to these
Men’s Judgment, we are in a far worse Condition, having nothing
but the outward Letter of the Scripture to guess and divine from;
concerning the Sense or Meaning of one Verse of which scarce two can
be found to agree. But Jesus Christ hath promised us better Things,
tho’ many are so unwise as not to believe him, even to guide us by his
own unerring Spirit, and hath rent and removed the Veil, whereby
not only one, and that once a Year, may enter; but all of us, at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
Times, have Access unto him, as often as we draw near unto him with
pure Hearts: He reveals his Will to us by his Spirit, and writes his Laws
in our Hearts. These Things then being thus premised; I argue,</p>

<p>Where the Law of God is put into the Mind, and written in the
Heart, there the Object of Faith, and Revelation of the Knowledge
of God, is <i>inward</i>, <i>immediate</i>, and <i>objective</i>.</p>

<p>But the Law of God is put into the Mind, and written in the
Heart of every True Christian, under the new Covenant:</p>

<p>Therefore the Object of Faith, and Revelation of the Knowledge
of God to every True Christian, is inward, immediate, and objective.</p>

<p>The <i>Assumption</i> is the express Words of Scripture: The <i>Proposition</i>
then must needs be true, except that <i>which is put into the Mind, and
written in the Heart</i>, were either not <i>inward</i>, not <i>immediate</i>, or not <i>objective</i>,
which is most absurd.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 3. The Anointing recommended, as</i>,</span>The third Argument is from these Words of <i>John</i>, 1 <i>John</i> ii.
Ver. 27. <i>But the Anointing, which ye have received of him, abideth in you,
and ye need not that any Man teach you: But the same Anointing teacheth you
of all Things, and is Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught you,
ye shall abide in him.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>1. Common.</i></span><i>First</i>, This could not be any special, peculiar, or extraordinary
Privilege, but that which is common to all the Saints, it being a
general Epistle, directed to all them of that Age.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>2. Certain.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, The Apostle proposeth this Anointing in them, as a more
certain Touch-stone for them to discern and try Seducers by, even than
his own Writings; for having in the former Verse said, that he had
written some Things to them concerning such as seduced them, he
begins the next Verse, <i>But the Anointing</i>, &amp;c. <i>and ye need not that any
Man teach you</i>, &amp;c. which infers, that having said to them what can
be said, he refers them for all to the inward Anointing, which
teacheth all Things, as the most firm, constant, and certain Bulwark,
against all Seducers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>3. Lasting.</i></span>And <i>Lastly</i>, That it is a lasting and continuing Thing; the Anointing
which abideth. If it had not been to abide in them, it could not
have taught them all Things, neither guarded them against all
Hazard. From which I argue thus,</p>

<p>He that hath an Anointing abiding in him, which teacheth him
all Things, so that he needs no Man to teach him, hath an inward
and immediate Teacher, and hath some Things inwardly and immediately
Revealed unto him.</p>

<p>But the Saints have such an Anointing:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I could prove this Doctrine from many more Places of Scripture,
which for Brevity’s Sake I omit; and now come to the second Part
of the Proposition, where the Objections usually formed against it are
answered.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>The most usual is, That <i>these Revelations are uncertain</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But this bespeaketh much Ignorance in the Opposers; for we
distinguish between the <i>Thesis</i> and the <i>Hypothesis</i>; that is, between the
<i>Proposition</i> and <i>Supposition</i>. For it is one Thing to affirm, <i>that the true
and undoubted Revelation of God’s Spirit is certain and infallible</i>; and another
Thing to affirm, that this or that particular Person, or People, is
led infallibly by this Revelation, in what they speak or write, because
they affirm themselves to be so led, by the inward and immediate
Revelation of the Spirit. The first is only asserted by us; the
latter may be called in question. The Question is not, Who are, or
are not so led? But, Whether all ought not, or may not be so led?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Certainty of the Spirit’s Guidance proved.</i></span>Seeing then we have already proved, that Christ hath promised
his Spirit to lead his Children, and that every one of them both
ought and may be led by it; if any depart from this certain Guide
in Deeds, and yet in Words pretend to be led by it, into Things that
are not good, it will not from thence follow, that the true Guidance
of the Spirit is uncertain, or ought not to be followed; no more than
it will follow, that the Sun sheweth not Light, because a Blind Man,
or one who wilfully hurts his Eyes, falls into a Ditch at Noon-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
for want of Light; or that no Words are spoken, because a Deaf
Man hears them not; or that a Garden full of fragrant Flowers has
no sweet Smell, because he that has lost his Smelling doth not Smell
it. The Fault then is in the Organ, and not in the Object.</p>

<p>All these Mistakes therefore are to be ascribed to the Weakness or
Wickedness of Men, and not to that Holy Spirit. Such as bend
themselves most against this certain and infallible Testimony of the
Spirit, use commonly to alledge the Example of the old <i>Gnosticks</i>, and
the late Monstrous and Mischievous Actings of the <i>Anabaptists</i> of <i>Munster</i>;
all which toucheth us nothing at all, neither weakens a Whit
our most true Doctrine. Wherefore, as a most sure Bulwark against
such Kind of Assaults, was subjoined that other Part of our Proposition,
thus; <i>Moreover these Divine and Inward Revelations, which we establish,
as absolutely necessary for the founding of the True Faith, as they do not,
so neither can they at any Time contradict the Scriptures Testimony, or sound
Reason</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>By Experience.</i></span>Besides the intrinsick and undoubted Truth of this Assertion, we
can boldly affirm it, from our certain and blessed Experience. For
this Spirit never deceived us, never acted nor moved us to any Thing
that was amiss; but is clear and manifest in its Revelations, which
are evidently discerned by us, as we wait in that <i>pure and undefiled
Light of God</i>, that proper and fit <i>Organ</i>, in which they are received.
Therefore if any reason after this Manner,</p>

<p><i>That because some Wicked, Ungodly, Devilish Men, have committed wicked
Actions, and have yet more wickedly asserted, that they were led into these Things
by the Spirit of God</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>No Man ought to lean to the Spirit of God, or seek to be led
by it</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Absurdity of the Consequence.</i></span>I utterly deny the Consequence of this Proposition; which, were it
to be received as true, then would all <i>Faith in God</i>, and <i>Hope of Salvation</i>,
become uncertain, and the <i>Christian Religion</i> be turned into mere
<i>Scepticism</i>. For after the same Manner I might reason thus:</p>

<p>Because <i>Eve</i> was deceived by the <i>Lying of the Serpent</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Therefore she ought not to have trusted to the <i>Promise of God</i>.</p>

<p>Because the old World was deluded by <i>Evil Spirits</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore ought neither <i>Noah</i>, nor <i>Abraham</i>, nor <i>Moses</i>, to have
trusted the <i>Spirit of the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>Because a lying Spirit spake through the Four Hundred Prophets,
that persuaded <i>Ahab</i> to go up and fight at <i>Ramoth Gilead</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore the Testimony of the <i>true Spirit in Micaiah</i> was uncertain,
and dangerous to be followed.</p>

<p>Because there were <i>seducing Spirits</i> crept into the Church of old:</p>

<p>Therefore it was not good, or it is uncertain, to follow the <i>Anointing</i>,
which taught all Things, and is Truth, and is no Lie.</p>

<p>Who dare say, that this is a necessary Consequence? Moreover,
not only the Faith of the Saints, and Church of God of old, is hereby
rendered uncertain, but also the Faith of all Sorts of Christians
now is liable to the like Hazard, even of those who seek a Foundation
for their Faith elsewhere than from the Spirit. For I shall prove
by an inevitable Argument, <i>ab Incommodo</i>, i. e. from the Inconveniency
of it, that if the Spirit be not to be followed upon that Account,
and that Men may not depend upon it, as their Guide, because some,
while pretending thereunto, commit great Evils; that then, neither
Tradition, nor the Scriptures, nor Reason, which the <i>Papists</i>, <i>Protestants</i>
and <i>Socinians</i>, do respectively make the Rule of their Faith, are any
Whit more certain.
<span class="sidenote"><i>1. Instances of Tradition.</i></span>The <i>Romanists</i> reckon it an Error to celebrate
<i>Easter</i> any other Ways than that Church doth. This can only be decided
by Tradition. And yet the <i>Greek</i> Church, which equally layeth
Claim to Tradition with herself, doth it otherwise. <a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>Yea, so little
effectual is Tradition to decide the Case, that <i>Polycarpus</i>, the Disciple
of <i>John</i>, and <i>Anicetus</i>, the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who immediately succeeded
them, according to whole Example both Sides concluded the Question
ought to be decided, <i>could not agree</i>. Here of Necessity one of them must
Err, and that following Tradition. Would the <i>Papists</i> now judge we
dealt fairly by them, if we should thence aver, that Tradition is not
to be regarded? Besides, in a Matter of far greater Importance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
same Difficulty will occur, to wit, in the Primacy of the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>; for many do affirm, and that by Tradition, That in the first Six
Hundred Years the <i>Roman Prelates</i> never assumed the Title of <i>Universal
Shepherd</i>, nor were acknowledged as such. And as that which
altogether overturneth this Presidency, there are that alledge, and
that from Tradition also, That <i>Peter</i> never saw <i>Rome</i>; and that therefore
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> cannot be his Successor. Would ye <i>Romanists</i>
think this sound Reasoning, to say as you do?</p>

Tradition:</p>

<p>Therefore we ought to reject all Traditions, yea, even those by

<p><i>Lastly</i>, In the<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Council of <i>Florence</i>, the chief Doctors of the <i>Romish</i>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="correction" title="Sidnote missing from original book."><i>2. Of Scripture.</i></span></span><i>Secondly</i>, As to the Scripture, the same Difficulty occurreth: The
<i>Lutherans</i> affirm they believe Consubstantiation by the Scripture;
which the <i>Calvinists</i> deny, as that which, they say, according to the
same Scripture, is a gross Error. The <i>Calvinists</i> again affirm <i>absolute
Predestination</i>, which the <i>Arminians</i> deny, affirming the contrary; wherein
both affirm themselves to be ruled by the Scripture and Reason in
the Matter. Should I argue thus then to the <i>Calvinists</i>?</p>

<p>Here the <i>Lutherans</i> and <i>Arminians</i> <span class="correction" title="In the original book: grosly">grossly</span> err, by following the Scripture:</p>

<p>Therefore the Scripture is not a good nor certain Rule; and <i>è
contrario</i>.</p>

<p>Would either of them accept of this Reasoning as good and sound?
What shall I say of the <i>Episcopalians</i>, <i>Presbyterians</i>, <i>Independents</i>, and
<i>Anabaptists</i> of <i>Great Britain</i>, who are continually buffeting one another
with the Scripture? To whom the same Argument might be
alledged, though they do all unanimously acknowledge it to be the
Rule.</p>

whence come all the Controversies, Contentions and Debates in the
World, but because every Man thinks he follows right Reason?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Debates hence arising betwixt the old and late Philosophers.</i></span>Hence of old, came the Jangles between the <i>Stoicks</i>, <i>Platonists</i>, <i>Peripateticks</i>,

the <i>Socinians</i>, those great Reasoners, allow us to conclude, because
many, and those very wise Men, have erred, by following, as they
supposed, their Reason, and that with what Diligence, Care and Industry
they could, to find out the Truth, that therefore no Man ought
to make use of it at all, nor be positive in what he knows certainly
to be Rational? And thus far as to Opinions; the same Uncertainty
is no less incident unto those other Principles.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Anabaptists<i> for their wild Practices, and </i>Protestants<i> and </i>Papists<i> for their Wars and Bloodshed, each pretending Scripture for it.</i></span>But if we come to Practices, though I confess I do with
my whole Heart abhor and detest those wild Practices, which are
written concerning the <i>Anabaptists</i> of <i>Munster</i>; I am bold to say, as
bad, if not worse Things, have been committed by those that lean
to Tradition, Scripture, and Reason: Wherein also they have averred
themselves to have been authorized by these Rules. I need but mention
all the Tumults, Seditions, and horrible Bloodshed, wherewith
<i>Europe</i> hath been afflicted these divers Ages; in which <i>Papists</i> against
<i>Papists</i>, <i>Calvinists</i> against <i>Calvinists</i>, <i>Lutherans</i> against <i>Lutherans</i>, and <i>Papists</i>,
assisted by <i>Protestants</i>, against other <i>Protestants</i> assisted by <i>Papists</i>,
have miserably Shed one another’s Blood, Hiring and Forcing Men
to kill each other, who were Ignorant of the Quarrel, and Strangers
one to another: All, mean while, pretending Reason for so doing,
and pleading the Lawfulness of it from Scripture.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Tradition, Scripture, and Reason, made a Cover for Persecution and Murder.</i></span>For what have the <i>Papists</i> pretended for their many <i>Massacres</i>, acted
as well in <i>France</i> as elsewhere, but <i>Tradition</i>, <i>Scripture</i>, and <i>Reason</i>?
Did they not say, That <i>Reason</i> persuaded them, <i>Tradition</i> allowed
them, and <i>Scripture</i> commanded them, to Persecute, Destroy, and Burn
<i>Hereticks</i>, such as denied this plain Scripture, <i>Hoc est Corpus meum,
This is my Body?</i> And are not the <i>Protestants</i> assenting to this Bloodshed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
who assert the same Thing, and encourage them, by Burning
and Banishing, while their Brethren are so treated for the same Cause?
Are not the Islands of <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, yea, and all the
Christian World, a lively Example hereof, which were divers Years
together as a Theatre of Blood; where many lost their Lives, and
Numbers of Families were utterly destroyed and ruined? For all
which no other Cause was principally given, than the Precepts of
the Scripture. If we then compare these Actings with those of <i>Munster</i>,
we shall not find great Difference; for both affirmed and pretended
they were called, and that it was lawful to Kill, Burn, and
Destroy the Wicked. <i>We must Kill all the Wicked, </i>said those<i> Anabaptists,
that we, that are the Saints, may possess the Earth. We must Burn obstinate
Hereticks, </i>say the<i> Papists, that the </i>Holy Church of Rome<i> may be purged
of rotten Members, and may live in Peace. We must cut off </i>Seducing Separatists,
say the<i> Prelatical Protestants, who trouble the Peace of the Church,
and refuse the </i>Divine Hierarchy<i>, and </i>Religious Ceremonies<i> thereof.
We must Kill, </i>say the<i> Calvinistick Presbyterians, the Prophane Malignants,
who accuse the </i>Holy Consistorial<i> and </i>Presbyterian Government<i>, and seek
to defend the </i>Popish<i> and </i>Prelatick Hierarchy<i>; as also those other </i>Sectaries<i>
that trouble the Peace of our Church.</i> What Difference I pray thee,
Impartial Reader, seest thou betwixt these?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>The </i>Anabaptists<i> went without, and against the Authority of
the </i>Magistrate<i>; so did not the other</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I might easily Refute it, by alledging the mutual Testimonies of
these <i>Sects</i> against one another.
<span class="sidenote">Examples of Popish Cruelties.</span>The Behaviour of the <i>Papists</i> towards
<i>Henry</i> the third and fourth of <i>France</i>; their Designs upon <i>James</i> the
sixth in the Gunpowder Treason; as also their Principle of the <i>Pope</i>’s
Power to depose Kings, for the Cause of <i>Heresy</i>, and to absolve their
Subjects from their <i>Oath</i>, and give them to others, proves it against
them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Protestants Violences and Persecutions in</i> Scotland, England, <i>and</i> Holland.</span>And as to the <i>Protestants</i>, how much their Actions differ from those
other above-mentioned, may be seen by the many Conspiracies and
Tumults which they have been active in, both in <i>Scotland</i> and <i>England</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
and which they have acted within these Hundred Years, in divers
Towns and Provinces of the <i>Netherlands</i>. Have they not oftentimes
sought, not only from the <i>Popish Magistrates</i>, but even from those that
had begun to Reform, or that had given them some Liberty of Exercising
their Religion, that they might only be permitted, without
Trouble or Hindrance, to Exercise their Religion, promising they
would not hinder or molest the <i>Papists</i> in the Exercise of theirs? And
yet did they not on the contrary, so soon as they had Power, trouble
and abuse those Fellow-Citizens, and turn them out of the City, and,
which is worse, even such, who together with them had forsaken the
Popish Religion? Did they not these Things in many Places against
the Mind of the Magistrates? Have they not publickly, with contumelious
Speeches, assaulted their Magistrates, from whom they had
but just before sought and obtained the free Exercise of their Religion?
Representing them, so soon as they opposed themselves to their
<i>Hierarchy</i>, as if they regarded neither God nor Religion? Have they not
by violent Hands possessed themselves of the <i>Popish Churches</i>, so called,
or by Force, against the Magistrates Mind, taken them away? Have
they not turned out of their Office and Authority whole Councils of
Magistrates, under Pretence that they were addicted to <i>Popery</i>? Which
<i>Popish Magistrates</i> nevertheless they did but a little before acknowledge
to be Ordained by God; affirming themselves obliged to yield them
Obedience and Subjection, not only for Fear, but for Conscience Sake;
to whom moreover the very Preachers and Overseers of the Reformed
Church had willingly sworn Fidelity; and yet afterwards have they
not said, That the People are bound to force a wicked Prince to the
Observation of God’s Word? There are many other Instances of this
Kind to be found in their <i>Histories</i>, not to mention many worse Things,
which we know to have been acted in our Time, and which for Brevity’s
Sake I pass by.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lutheran<i> Seditions against the Reformed Teachers, and Assault upon the Marquis of </i>Brandenburg<i>, &amp;c. in </i>Germany.</span>I might say much of the <i>Lutherans</i>, whose tumultuous Actions
against their Magistrates, not professing the <i>Lutheran Profession</i>, are
testified of by several Historians worthy of Credit. Among others, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
shall propose only one Example to the Reader’s Consideration, which
fell out at <i>Berlin</i>, in the Year 1615, “Where the seditious Multitude
of the <i>Lutheran</i> Citizens, being stirred up by the daily Clamours
of their Preachers, did not only with Violence break into the
Houses of the reformed Teachers, overturn their Libraries, and
spoil their Furniture; but also with reproachful Words, yea, and
with Stones, assaulted the Marquis of <i>Brandenburg</i>, the Elector’s
Brother, while he sought by smooth Words to quiet the Fury of
the Multitude; they killed ten of his Guard, scarcely sparing himself,
who at last by Flight escaped out of their Hands.”</p>

<p>All which sufficiently declares, that the Concurrence of the Magistrate
doth not alter their Principles, but only their Method of Procedure.
So that for my own Part, I see no Difference betwixt the
Actings of those of <i>Munster</i>, and these others, (whereof the one pretended
to be led by the <i>Spirit</i>, the other by <i>Tradition</i>, <i>Scripture</i>, and
<i>Reason</i>) save this, that the former were rash, heady, and foolish, in
their Proceedings, and therefore were the sooner brought to nothing,
and so into Contempt and Derision: But the other, being more politick
and wise in their Generation, held it out longer, and so have
authorized their Wickedness more, with the seeming Authority of Law
and Reason. But both their Actings being equally Evil, the Difference
appears to me to be only like that which is between a simple
silly Thief, that is easily catched, and hanged without any more ado;
and a Company of resolute bold Robbers, who being better guarded,
though their Offence be nothing less, yet by Violence do, to shun the
Danger, force their Masters to give them good Terms.</p>

<p>From all which then it evidently follows, that they argue very ill,
who despise and reject any Principle, because Men pretending to be
led by it do evil; in case it be not the natural and consequential
Tendency of that Principle to lead unto those Things that are evil.</p>

<p>Again, It doth follow from what is above asserted, that if the
Spirit be to be rejected upon this Account, all those other Principles
ought on the same Account to be rejected. And for my Part, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
have never a Whit the lower Esteem of the blessed Testimony of the
Holy Scriptures; nor do the less respect any solid Tradition, that is
answerable and according to Truth; neither at all despise Reason,
that noble and excellent Faculty of the Mind, because wicked Men
have abused the Name of them, to cover their Wickedness, and deceive
the Simple;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Let none reject the Certainty of the unerring Spirit of God because of false Pretenders to it.</i></span>so would I not have any reject or doubt the Certainty
of that Unerring Spirit, which God hath given his Children,
as that which can alone guide them into all Truth, because some
have <span class="correction" title="In the original book: falsly">falsely</span> pretended to it.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XV.</h3> And because the Spirit of God is the Fountain of all
Truth and sound Reason, therefore we have well said, That <i>it cannot
contradict either the Testimony of the Scripture, or right Reason</i>: “<i>Yet </i>(as
the Proposition itself concludeth, to the last Part of which I now
come)<i> it will not from thence follow, that these Divine Revelations are to be
subjected to the Examination either by the outward Testimony of Scripture, or of
the human or natural Reason of Man, as to a more noble and certain Rule
or Touch-stone; for the Divine Revelation, and Inward Illumination, is that
which is evident by itself, forcing the well-disposed Understanding, and irresistibly
moving it to assent, by its own Evidence and Clearness; even as the common
Principles of natural Truths do bend the Mind to a natural Assent.</i>”</div>

<p>He that denies this Part of the Proposition, must needs affirm, that
the Spirit of God neither can nor ever hath manifested itself to Man,
without the Scripture, or a distinct Discussion of Reason; or that the
Efficacy of this Supernatural Principle, working upon the Souls of
Men, is less evident than Natural Principles in their common Operations;
both which are false.</p>

<p>For, <i>First</i>, Through all the Scriptures we may observe, That the
Manifestation and Revelation of God by his Spirit to the Patriarchs,
Prophets, and Apostles, was <i>Immediate</i> and <i>Objective</i>, as is above proved;
which they did not examine by any other Principle, but their own
Evidence and Clearness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Self-Evidence of the Spirit.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, To say that the Spirit of God has less Evidence upon the
Mind of Man than Natural Principles have, is to have too mean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
too low Thoughts of it. How comes <i>David</i> to invite us, to <i>taste and
see that God is good</i>, if this cannot be felt and tasted? This were enough
to overturn the Faith and Assurance of all the Saints, both now and
of old. How came <i>Paul</i> to be persuaded, that <i>nothing could separate
him from the Love of God</i>, but by that Evidence and Clearness which
the Spirit of God gave him? The Apostle <i>John</i>, who knew well
wherein the Certainty of Faith consisted, judged it no ways absurd,
without further Argument, to ascribe his Knowledge and Assurance,
and that of all the Saints, hereunto in these Words, <i>Hereby know we,
that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit</i>,
1 John iv. 13. And again, Ver. 6. It is <i>the Spirit that beareth Witness,
because the Spirit is Truth</i>.</p>

<p>Observe the Reason brought by him, <i>Because the Spirit is Truth</i>; of
whose Certainty and Infallibility I have heretofore spoken.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Spirit contradicts not the Scripture, nor right Reason.</i></span>We then
trust to and confide in this Spirit, because we know, and certainly
believe, that it can only lead us aright, and never mislead us; and
from this certain Confidence it is that we affirm, That no Revelation
coming from it can ever contradict the Scripture’s Testimony, nor
right Reason: Not as making this a more certain Rule to ourselves,
but as condescending to such, who not discerning the Revelations of
the Spirit, as they proceed purely from God, will try them by these
<i>Mediums</i>. Yet those that have their Spiritual Senses, and can savour
the Things of the Spirit, as it were <i>in prima Instantia</i>, i. e. at the first
Blush, can discern them without, or before they apply them either
to Scripture or Reason:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Natural Demonstrations from </i>Astronomy<i> and </i>Geometry.</span>Just as a good <i>Astronomer</i> can calculate an
Eclipse infallibly, by which he can conclude (if the Order of Nature
continue, and some strange and unnatural Revolution intervene not)
there will be an Eclipse of the Sun or Moon such a Day, and such
an Hour; yet can he not persuade an ignorant Rustick of this, until
he visibly see it. So also a <i>Mathematician</i> can infallibly know, by the
Rules of Art, that the three Angles of a right Triangle are equal to
two right Angles; yea, can know them more certainly than any
Man by Measure. And some <i>Geometrical Demonstrations</i> are by all ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>knowledged
to be infallible, which can be scarcely discerned or
proved by the Senses; yet if a <i>Geometer</i> be at the Pains to certify
some ignorant Man concerning the Certainty of his Art, by condescending
to measure it, and make it obvious to his Senses, it will not
thence follow, that that Measuring is so certain as the Demonstration
itself; or that the Demonstration would be uncertain without it.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVI.</h3> But to make an End, I shall add one Argument to prove,
That this Inward, Immediate, Objective Revelation, which we have
pleaded for all along, is the only, sure, certain, and unmoveable
Foundation of all <i>Christian Faith</i>; which Argument, when well considered,
I hope will have Weight with all Sorts of Christians, and it
is this:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Immediate Revelation the Immoveable Foundation of all Christian Faith.</i></span>That which all Professors of <i>Christianity</i>, of what Kind soever, are
forced ultimately to recur unto, when pressed to the last; That for
and because of which all other Foundations are recommended, and
accounted worthy to be Believed, and without which they are
granted to be of no Weight at all, must needs be the only most true,
certain, and unmoveable Foundation of all Christian Faith.</p>

<p>But Inward, Immediate, Objective Revelation by the Spirit, is
that which all Professors of <i>Christianity</i>, of what Kind soever, are forced
ultimately to recur unto, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Proposition is so evident, that it will not be denied: The Assumption
shall be proved by Parts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Papists <i>Foundation, their Church and Tradition</i>, Why?</span>And <i>First</i>, As to the <i>Papists</i>, they place their Foundation in the
Judgment of the <i>Church</i> and <i>Tradition</i>. If we press them to say, Why
they believe as the <i>Church</i> doth? Their answer is, <i>Because the Church
is always led by the infallible Spirit</i>. So here the <i>Leading of the Spirit</i> is
the utmost Foundation. Again, if we ask them, Why we ought to
trust <i>Tradition</i>? They answer, <i>Because these Traditions were delivered us
by the Doctors and Fathers of the Church; which Doctors and Fathers, by the
Revelation of the Holy Ghost, commanded the Church to observe them</i>. Here
again all ends in the Revelation of the Spirit.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Protestants <i>and</i> Socinians <i>make the Scriptures their Ground and Foundation</i>, Why?</span>And for the <i>Protestants</i> and <i>Socinians</i>, both which acknowledge the
Scriptures to be the Foundation and Rule of their Faith; the one as
subjectively influenced by the Spirit of God to use them; the other,
as managing them with and by their own Reason; ask both, or
either of them, Why they trust in the <i>Scriptures</i>, and take them to be
their Rule? Their Answer is, <i>Because we have in them the Mind of God
delivered unto us by those to whom these Things were inwardly, immediately,
and objectively Revealed by the Spirit of God</i>; and not because this or
that Man wrote them, but because the <i>Spirit of God</i> dictated them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Christians <i>by Name, and not by Nature, hold Revelation ceased, contrary to Scripture</i>.</span>It is strange then that Men should render that so uncertain and
dangerous to follow, upon which alone the certain Ground and
Foundation of their own Faith is built; or that they should shut themselves
out from that Holy Fellowship with God, which only is enjoyed
in the Spirit, in which we are commanded both to Walk and
Live.</p>

<p>If any who read these Things find themselves moved, by the Strength
of these Scripture-Arguments, to assent, and believe such Revelations
necessary; and yet find themselves Strangers to them, which, as
I observed in the Beginning, is the Cause that this is so much gainsaid
and contradicted, let them know, that it is not because it is
ceased to become the Privilege of every true Christian that they do
not feel it, but rather because they are not so much Christians by
Nature as by Name; and let such know, that the secret <i>Light</i> which
shines in the Heart, and reproves Unrighteousness, is the small Beginning
of the Revelation of God’s Spirit, which was first sent into
the World to reprove it of Sin, <i>John</i> xvi. 8. And as by forsaking
Iniquity, thou comest to be acquainted with that Heavenly Voice in
thy Heart, thou shalt feel, as the Old Man, or the Natural Man, that
savoureth not the Things of God’s Kingdom, is put off, with his evil
and corrupt Affections and Lusts; I say, thou shalt feel the New Man,
or the Spiritual Birth and Babe raised, which hath its Spiritual Senses,
and can see, feel, taste, handle, and smell the Things of the Spirit; but
till then the Knowledge of Things Spiritual is but as an Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
Faith.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Who wants his Sight sees not the Light.</i></span>But as the Description of the Light of the Sun, or of curious
Colours to a blind Man, who, though of the largest Capacity, cannot
so well understand it by the most acute and lively Description,
as a Child can by seeing them; so neither can the Natural Man, of
the largest Capacity, by the best Words, even Scripture-words, so well
understand the <i>Mysteries</i> of <i>God’s Kingdom</i>, as the least and weakest
Child who tasteth them, by having them Revealed <i>inwardly</i> and <i>objectively</i>
by the Spirit.</p>

<p>Wait then for this in the small Revelation of that pure Light,
which first reveals Things more known; and as thou becomest fitted
for it, thou shalt receive more and more, and by a Living Experience
easily refute their Ignorance, who ask, How dost thou know that
thou art actuated by the Spirit of God? Which will appear to thee
a Question no less ridiculous, than to ask one whose Eyes are open,
How he knows the Sun shines at Noon-day? And though this be the
surest and most certain Way to answer all Objections; yet by what is
above written it may appear, that the Mouths of all such Opposers
as deny this Doctrine may be shut, by unquestionable and unanswerable
Reasons.</p>

Apology for itself, yet it is a good Apology for us, and will
help to sweep away that, among many other Calumnies, wherewith
we are often loaded, as if we were Vilifiers and Deniers of the Scriptures;
for in that which we affirm of them, it doth appear at what
high Rate we value them, accounting them, without all Deceit

<span class="sidenote"><i>The Holy Scriptures the most excellent Writings in the World.</i></span>to which not only no other Writings are to be preferred, but even in

<p>“But if (saith he) we respect the Consciences, that they be not
daily molested with Doubts, and hesitate not at every Scruple, it
is requisite that this Persuasion which we speak of be taken higher
than human Reason, Judgment, or Conjecture; to wit, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
secret Testimony of the Spirit.” <i>And again</i>, “To those who ask,
that <i>we prove unto them, by Reason, that </i>Moses<i> and the </i>Prophets<i> were
inspired of God to speak</i>, I answer, That the Testimony of the Holy
Spirit is more excellent than all Reason.” <i>And again</i>, “Let this
remain a firm Truth, that he only whom the Holy Spirit hath
persuaded, can repose himself on the Scripture with a true Certainty.”

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Confession of the </i>French<i> Churches.</i></span>The same is also affirmed in the first publick Confession of the
<i>French</i> Churches, published in the Year 1559. <i>Art. 4.</i> “We know
these Books to be canonical, and the most certain Rule of our
Faith, not so much by the common Accord and Consent of the
Church, as by the Testimony and inward Persuasion of the Holy
Spirit.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Churches of </i>Holland<i> assert the same.</i></span>Thus also in the 5th Article of the Confession of Faith, of the
Churches of <i>Holland</i>, confirmed by the Synod of <i>Dort</i>. “We receive
these Books only for holy and canonical,&mdash;not so much because
the Church receives and approves them, as because the Spirit of
God doth witness in our Hearts that they are of God.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Westminster <i>Confession the same</i>.</span>And lastly, The <i>Divines</i>, so called, at <i>Westminster</i>, who began to be
afraid of, and guard against the Testimony of the Spirit, because
they perceived a Dispensation beyond that which they were under
beginning to dawn, and to eclipse them; yet could they not get by
this, though they have laid it down neither so clearly, distinctly,
nor honestly as they that went before. It is in these Words, <i>Chap. 1.

<p>By all which it appeareth how necessary it is to seek the Certainty
of the Scriptures from the Spirit, and no where else. The infinite
Janglings and endless Contests of those that seek their Authority
elsewhere, do witness to the Truth hereof.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3> Though then we do acknowledge the Scriptures to be very
heavenly and divine Writings, the Use of them to be very comfortable
and necessary to the Church of Christ, and that we also admire and
give Praise to the Lord, for his wonderful Providence in preserving
these Writings so pure and uncorrupted as we have them, through so
long a Night of Apostasy, to be a Testimony of his Truth against the
Wickedness and Abominations even of those whom he made instrumental
in preserving them, so that they have kept them to be a Witness
against themselves;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Scriptures are not the principal Ground of Truth.</i></span>yet we may not call them the principal
Fountain of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the first adequate
Rule of Faith and Manners; because the principal Fountain of Truth
must be the Truth itself; <i>i. e.</i> that whole Certainty and Authority depends
not upon another. When we doubt of the Streams of any River or
Flood, we recur to the Fountain itself; and having found it, there we
desist, we can go no farther, because there it springs out of the Bowels
of the Earth, which are inscrutable. Even so the Writings and Sayings
of all Men we must bring to the Word of God, I mean the
Eternal Word, and if they agree hereunto, we stand there. For this
Word always proceedeth, and doth eternally proceed from God, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
and by which the unsearchable Wisdom of God, and unsearchable
Counsel and Will conceived in the Heart of God, is revealed unto
us. That then the Scripture is not the principal Ground of Faith
and Knowledge, as it appears by what is above spoken, so it is
proved in the latter Part of the Proposition; which being reduced
to an Argument, runs thus:</div>

<p>That whereof the Certainty and Authority depends upon another,
and which is received as Truth because of its proceeding from another,
is not to be accounted the principal Ground and Origin of
all Truth and Knowledge:</p>

<p>But the Scriptures Authority and Certainty depend upon the
Spirit by which they were dictated; and the Reason why they were
received as Truth is, because they proceeded from the Spirit:</p>

<p>Therefore they are not the principal Ground of Truth.</p>

<p>To confirm this Argument, I added the School Maxim, <i>Propter
quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum magis est tale</i>. Which Maxim,
though I confess it doth not hold universally in all Things, yet in
this it doth and will very well hold, as by applying it, as we have
above intimated, will appear.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Neither are they the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</i></span>The same Argument will hold as to the other Branch of the Proposition,
<i>That it is not the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners</i>;
thus:</p>

<p>That which is not the Rule of my Faith in believing the Scriptures
themselves, is not the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>That the Spirit is the Rule.</i></span>But the Scripture is not, nor can it be the Rule of that Faith by
which I believe them, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>But as to this Part, we shall produce divers Arguments hereafter.
As to what is affirmed, that the <i>Spirit, </i>and<i> not the Scriptures, is the Rule</i>,
it is largely handled in the former Proposition; the Sum whereof I
shall subsume in one Argument, thus,</p>

<p>If by the Spirit we can only come to the true Knowledge of God;
if by the Spirit we are to be led into all Truth, and so be taught of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
all Things; then the Spirit, and not the Scriptures, is the Foundation
and Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, and the primary
Rule of Faith and Manners:</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the last.</p>

<p>Next, the very Nature of the Gospel itself declareth that the Scriptures
cannot be the <i>only</i> and <i>chief Rule</i> of <i>Christians</i>, else there should
be no Difference betwixt the <i>Law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i>; as from the Nature
of the New Covenant, by divers Scriptures, described in the former
Proposition, is proved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Wherein the Law and Gospel differ.</i></span>But besides these which are before mentioned, herein doth the
<i>Law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i> differ, in that the <i>Law</i>, being outwardly written,
brings under <i>Condemnation</i>, but hath <i>not Life</i> in it to <i>save</i>; whereas
the <i>Gospel</i>, as it declares and makes manifest the Evil, so, being an
inward powerful Thing, it gives Power also to obey, and deliver
from the Evil. Hence it is called [Greek: Evangelian: Ευαγγελιον], which is <i>glad Tidings</i>.
The <i>Law</i> or <i>Letter</i>, which is <i>without</i> us, <i>Kills</i>; but the <i>Gospel</i>, which
is the <i>inward</i> spiritual <i>Law</i>, gives <i>Life</i>; for it consists not so much in
Words as in Virtue. Wherefore such as come to know it, and be
acquainted with it, come to feel greater Power over their Iniquities
than all outward Laws or Rules can give them. Hence the Apostle
concludes, <i>Rom.</i> vi. 14. <i>Sin shall not have Dominion over you: for ye are
not under the Law, but under Grace</i>. This Grace then that is <i>inward</i>,
and not an <i>outward</i> Law, is to be the Rule of Christians. Hereunto
the Apostle commends the Elders of the Church, saying, <i>Acts</i> xx. 32.
<i>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace,
which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them
which are sanctified.</i> He doth not commend them here to outward
Laws or Writings, but to the <i>Word of Grace</i>, which is inward; even
the <i>spiritual Law</i>, which makes free, as he elsewhere affirms, <i>Rom.</i> viii.
2. <i>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the
Law of Sin and Death.</i> This spiritual Law is that which the Apostle
declares he preached and directed People unto, which was not outward,
as by <i>Rom.</i> x. 8. is manifest; where distinguishing it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
the Law, he saith, <i>The Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth;
and this is the Word of Faith which we preach</i>. From what is above said,
I argue thus:</p>

<p>The principal Rule of <i>Christians</i> under the Gospel is not an outward
Letter, nor Law outwardly written and delivered, but an inward
spiritual Law, <i>engraven in the Heart, the Law of the Spirit of Life, the
Word that is nigh in the Heart and in the Mouth</i>.</p>

<p>But the Letter of the Scripture is outward, of itself a dead Thing,
a mere Declaration of good Things, but not the Things themselves:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Scripture not the Rule.</i></span>Therefore it is not, nor can be, the chief or principal Rule of
Christians.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3> <i>Thirdly</i>, That which is given to <i>Christians</i> for a Rule and
Guide, must needs be so full, that it may clearly and distinctly guide
and order them in all Things and Occurrences that may fall out.</div>

<p>But in that there are numberless Things, with regard to their
Circumstances, which particular Christians may be concerned in,
for which there can be no particular Rule had in the Scriptures:</p>

<p>Therefore the Scriptures cannot be a Rule to them.</p>

<p>I shall give an Instance in two or three Particulars to prove this
Proposition. It is not to be doubted but some Men are particularly
called to some particular Services; their being not found in which,
though the Act be no general positive Duty, yet in so far as it may
be required of them, is a great Sin to omit; forasmuch as God is
zealous of his Glory, and every Act of Disobedience to his Will manifested,
is enough not only to hinder one greatly from that Comfort
and inward Peace which otherwise he might have, but also bringeth
Condemnation.</p>

<p>As for Instance, Some are called to the Ministry of the Word:
<i>Paul </i>saith<i>, There was a Necessity upon him to preach the Gospel, wo unto me,
if I preach not.</i></p>

<p>If it be necessary that there be now Ministers of the Church, as
well as then, then there is the same Necessity upon some, more than
upon others, to occupy this Place; which Necessity, as it may be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>cumbent
upon particular Persons, the Scripture neither doth nor
can declare.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>That the Qualifications of a Minister are found in the Scripture,
and by applying these Qualifications to myself, I may know whether I be
fit for such a Place or not</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, The Qualifications of a <i>Bishop</i>, or <i>Minister</i>, as they are
mentioned both in the Epistle to <i>Timothy</i> and <i>Titus</i>, are such as may
be found in a private Christian; yea, which ought in some Measure
to be in every true Christian: So that this giveth a Man no Certainty.
Every Capacity to an Office giveth me not a sufficient Call
to it.</p>

<p>Next again, By what Rule shall I judge if I be so qualified? How
do I know that I am <i>sober</i>, <i>meek</i>, <i>holy</i>, <i>harmless</i>? Is it not the Testimony
of the Spirit in my <i>Conscience</i> that must assure me hereof? And
suppose that I was qualified and called, yet what Scripture-rule shall
inform me, Whether it be my Duty to preach in this or that Place,
in <i>France</i> or <i>England</i>, <i>Holland</i> or <i>Germany</i>? Whether I shall take up
my Time in confirming the Faithful, reclaiming Hereticks, or converting
Infidels, as also in writing Epistles to this or that Church?</p>

<p>The general Rules of the Scripture, viz. <i>To be diligent in my Duty,
to do all to the Glory of God, and for the Good of his Church</i>, can give me
no Light in this Thing. Seeing two different Things may both
have a Respect to that Way, yet may I commit a great Error and Offence
in doing the one, when I am called to the other. If <i>Paul</i>,
when his Face was turned by the Lord toward <i>Jerusalem</i>, had gone
back to <i>Achaia</i>, or <i>Macedonia</i>, he might have supposed he could have
done God more acceptable Service in preaching and confirming the
Churches, than in being shut up in Prison in <i>Judea</i>; but would God
have been pleased herewith? Nay certainly. <i>Obedience is better than
Sacrifice</i>; and it is not our doing that which is good simply that
pleaseth God, but that Good which he willeth us to do. Every
Member hath its particular Place in the Body, as the Apostle sheweth,
1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. If then, I being the Foot, should offer to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
the Office of the Hand; or being the Hand, that of the Tongue;
my Service would be troublesome, and not acceptable; and instead
of helping the Body, I should make a <i>Schism</i> in it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That which is good for one to do, may be sinful to another.</i></span>So that that
which is good for another to do, may be sinful to me: For as Masters
will have their Servants to obey them, according to their good
Pleasure, and not only in blindly doing that which may seem to them
to tend to their Master’s Profit, whereby it may chance (the Master
having Business both in the Field and in the House) that the Servant
that knows not his Master’s Will may go to the Field, when it is the
Mind of the Master he should stay and do the Business of the House,
would not this Servant then deserve a Reproof, for not answering
his Master’s Mind? And what Master is so sottish and careless, as,
having many Servants, to leave them in such Disorder as not to assign
each his particular Station, and not only the general Terms of doing
that which is profitable? which would leave them in various Doubts,
and certainly end in Confusion.</p>

<p>Shall we then dare to ascribe unto Christ, in the ordering of his
Church and Servants, that which in Man might justly be accounted
Disorder and Confusion?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Diversities of Gifts.</i></span>The Apostle sheweth this Distinction well,
Rom. xii. 6, 7, 8. <i>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that
is given to us; whether Prophecy, let us prophesy according to the Proportion
of Faith; or Ministry, let us wait on our Ministring; or he that teacheth, on
Teaching; or he that exhorteth, on Exhortation.</i> Now what Scripture-rule
sheweth me that I ought to exhort, rather than prophesy? or to
minister, rather than teach? Surely none at all. Many more Difficulties
of this Kind occur in the Life of a Christian.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Of Faith and Salvation can the Scripture assure thee?</i></span>Moreover, that which of all Things is most needful for him to
know, to wit, whether he really be in the Faith, and an Heir of
Salvation, or not, the Scripture can give him no Certainty in, neither
can it be a Rule to him. That this Knowledge is exceeding
desirable and comfortable all do unanimously acknowledge; besides
that it is especially commanded, 2 <i>Cor.</i> xiii. 5. <i>Examine yourselves whether
ye be in the Faith, prove yourselves; know ye not your own selves, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</i> And 2 <i>Pet.</i> i. 10. <i>Wherefore
the rather, Brethren, give all Diligence to make your Calling and Election
sure.</i> Now I say, What Scripture-rule can assure me that I have
true Faith? That my Calling and Election is sure?</p>

<p>If it be said, <i>By comparing the Scripture-marks of true Faith with mine</i>:</p>

<p>I demand, Wherewith shall I make this Observation? What shall
ascertain me that I am not mistaken? It cannot be the Scripture:
That is the Matter under Debate.</p>

<p>If it be said, <i>My own Heart</i>:</p>

<p>How unfit a Judge is it in its own Case? And how like to be
partial, especially if it be yet unrenewed? Doth not the Scripture
say, that <i>it is deceitful above all Things</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Heart of Man deceitful.</i></span>I find the Promises, I find the
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Threatnings">Threatenings</span> in the Scripture; but who telleth me that the one belongs
to me more than the other? The Scripture gives me a mere
Declaration of these Things, but makes no Application; so that the
Assumption must be of my own making, thus; as for Example: I
find this Proposition in Scripture;</p>

<p><i>He that believes, shall be saved</i>: Thence I draw the Assumption.</p>

<p>But I, <i>Robert, believe</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>I shall be saved</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Minor</i> is of my own making, not expressed in the Scripture;
and so a human Conclusion, not a divine Position; so that my Faith
and Assurance here is not built upon a Scripture Proposition, but
upon an human Principle; which, unless I be sure of elsewhere, the
Scripture gives me no Certainty in the Matter.</p>

<p>Again, If I should pursue the Argument further, and seek a new
<i>Medium</i> out of the Scripture, the same Difficulty would occur: Thus,</p>

<p>He that hath the true and certain Marks of true Faith, hath true
Faith:</p>

<p>But I have those Marks:</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i> I have true Faith.</p>

<p>For the Assumption is still here of my own making, and is not
found in the Scriptures; and by Consequence the Conclusion can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
be no better, since it still followeth the weaker Proposition.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The inward Testimony of the Spirit the Seal of Scripture-Promises.</i></span>This
is indeed so pungent, that the best of <i>Protestants</i>, who plead for this
Assurance, ascribe it to the inward Testimony of the Spirit, as <i>Calvin</i>,
in that large Citation, quoted in the Former Proposition. So that,
not to seek farther into the Writings of the primitive <i>Protestants</i>, which
are full of such Expressions, even the <i>Westminster</i> Confession of Faith
affirmeth, <i>Chap.</i> 18. <i>Sect.</i> 12. “This Certainty is not a bare Conjecture
and probable Persuasion, grounded upon fallible Hope,
but an infallible Assurance of Faith, founded upon the Divine
Truth of the Promise of Salvation; the inward Evidences of these
Graces, unto which these Promises are made; the Testimony of
the Spirit of Adoption, witnessing to our Spirits that we are the
Children of God; which Spirit is the <i>Earnest</i> of our <i>Inheritance,
whereby we are sealed to the Day of Redemption</i>.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the Scripture itself, wherein we are so earnestly pressed
to seek after this Assurance, doth not at all affirm itself a Rule sufficient
to give it, but wholly ascribeth it to the Spirit, as <i>Rom.</i> viii.
16. <i>The Spirit itself beareth Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children
of God.</i> 1 John iv. 13. <i>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in
us, because he hath given us of his Spirit</i>; and Chap. v. 6. <i>And it is the
Spirit that beareth Witness, because the Spirit is Truth.</i></p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>That the Scriptures are not the chief Rule.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, That cannot be the only, principal, nor chief Rule,
which doth not universally reach every Individual that needeth it to
produce the necessary Effect; and from the Use of which, either by
some innocent and sinless Defect, or natural, yet harmless and blameless
Imperfection, many who are within the Compass of the visible
Church, and may, without Absurdity, yea, with great Probability,
be accounted of the Elect, are necessarily excluded, and that either
wholly, or at least from the immediate Use thereof.
<span class="sidenote"><i>1. Deaf People Children, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ideots">Idiots</span> instanced.</i></span>But it so falls
out frequently concerning the Scriptures, in the Case of deaf People,
Children, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ideots">Idiots</span>, who can by no Means have the Benefit of the
Scriptures. Shall we then affirm, that they are without any Rule to
God-ward, or that they are all damned? As such an Opinion is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
itself very absurd, and inconsistent both with the Justice and Mercy of
God, so I know no sound Reason can be alledged for it. Now if we
may suppose any such to be under the <i>New Covenant Dispensation</i>, as I
know none will deny but that we may suppose it without any Absurdity,
we cannot suppose them without some Rule and Means of Knowledge;
seeing it is expresly affirmed, <i>They shall all be taught of God</i>, John
vi. 45. <i>And they shall all know me from the least to the greatest</i>, Heb. viii. 11.</div>

<p>But Secondly, Though we were rid of this Difficulty, how
many illiterate and yet good Men are there in the Church of God,
who cannot read a Letter in their own Mother Tongue? Which
Imperfection, though it be inconvenient, I cannot tell whether we
may safely affirm it to be sinful. These can have no immediate
Knowledge of the Rule of their Faith; so their Faith must needs depend
upon the Credit of other Men’s Reading or Relating it unto
them; where either the altering, adding, or omitting of a little
Word may be a Foundation in the poor Hearer of a very dangerous
Mistake, whereby he may either continue in some Iniquity ignorantly,
or believe a Lie confidently.
<span class="sidenote">2. Papists <i>conceal the Second Commandment from the People.</i></span>As for Example, The <i>Papists</i>
in all their Catechisms, and publick Exercises of Examinations towards
the People, have boldly cut away the Second Command, because
it seems so expresly to strike against their Adoration and Use of
Images; whereas many of these People, in whom by this Omission
this false Opinion is fostered, are under a simple Impossibility, or at
least a very great Difficulty, to be outwardly informed of this Abuse.
But further; suppose all could read the Scriptures in their own Language;
where is there one of a Thousand that hath that thorough
Knowledge of the Original Languages, in which they are written, so as
in that Respect immediately to receive the Benefit of them?
<span class="sidenote">3. <i>The Uncertainty of the </i>Interpreters<i> of the Scripture, and their Adulterating it.</i></span>Must not
all these here depend upon the Honesty and Faithfulness of the Interpreter?
Which how uncertain it is for a Man to build his Faith upon,
the many Corrections, Amendments, and various Essays, which
even among <i>Protestants</i> have been used (whereof the latter have constantly
blamed and corrected the former, as Guilty of Defects and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
Errors) doth sufficiently declare. And that even the last Translators
in the vulgar Languages need to be corrected (as I could prove at
large, were it proper in this Place) learned Men do confess.</p>

<p>But last of all, there is no less Difficulty occurs even to those
skilled in the Original Languages, who cannot so immediately receive
the Mind of the Authors in these Writings, as that their Faith
doth not at least obliquely depend upon the Honesty and Credit of
the Transcribers, since the Original Copies are granted by all not
to be now extant.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Hieron.">Jerome</span> <i>Epist. 28. ad</i> Lucin. <i>p. 247.</i></span>Of which Transcribers <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Jerom"><i>Jerome</i></span> in his Time complained,

<span class="sidenote"><i>Epiph. in Anachor. Tom. Oper.</i></span>And <i>Epiphanius</i> saith, <i>That in the good and correct Copies of

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The various Readings of the </i>Hebrew<i> Character</i>, &amp;c.</span>But further, the various Readings of the <i>Hebrew Character</i> by Reason

later Invention; the Disagreement of divers Citations of Christ and
the Apostles with those Passages in the Old Testament they appeal
to; the great Controversy among the Fathers, whereof some highly
approve the <i>Greek Septuagint</i>, decrying and rendering very doubtful
the <i>Hebrew Copy</i>, as in many Places vitiated, and altered by the

some Fathers that lived Centuries before him, affirmed to be a most
certain Thing; and the many various Readings in divers Copies of
the <i>Greek</i>, and the great Altercations among the Fathers of the first
three Centuries, who had greater Opportunity to be better informed
than we can now lay claim to, concerning the Books to be admitted
or rejected, as is above observed; I say, all these and
much more which might be alledged, puts the Minds even of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
Learned into infinite Doubts, Scruples, and inextricable Difficulties:
Whence we may very safely conclude, that Jesus Christ, who
promised to be <i>always</i> with his Children, to lead them into <i>all Truth</i>,
to guard them against the Devices of the Enemy, and to establish
their Faith upon an <i>unmoveable Rock</i>, left them not to be principally
ruled by that, which was subject in itself to many Uncertainties:
And therefore he gave them his <i>Spirit</i> as their principal Guide,
which neither Moths nor Time can wear out, nor Transcribers nor
Translators corrupt; which none are so young, none so illiterate,
none in so remote a Place but they may come to be reached, and
rightly informed by it.</p>

<p>Through and by the Clearness which that Spirit gives us, it is that
we are only best rid of those Difficulties that occur to us concerning
the Scriptures. The real and undoubted Experience whereof I myself
have been a Witness of, with great Admiration of the Love of
God to his Children in these latter Days:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Wrong Translations of Scripture discerned in the Spirit by the Unlearned in Letters.</i></span>For I have known some
of my Friends who profess the same Faith with me, faithful Servants
of the Most High God, and full of Divine Knowledge of his Truth,
as it was immediately and inwardly revealed to them by the Spirit,
from a true and living Experience, who not only were ignorant of
the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Hebrew</i>, but even some of them could not read their
own vulgar Language, who being pressed by their Adversaries with
some Citations out of the <i>English</i> Translation, and finding them to
disagree with the Manifestation of Truth in their own Hearts, have
boldly affirmed the Spirit of God never said so, and that it was certainly
wrong; for they did not believe that any of the holy Prophets
or Apostles had ever written so; which when I on this Account
seriously examined, I really found to be Errors and Corruptions
of the Translators; who (as in most Translations) do not so
much give us the genuine Signification of the Words, as strain them
to express that which comes nearest to that Opinion and Notion they
have of Truth. And this seemed to me to suit very well with that
Saying of <i>Augustine, Epist.</i> 19. <i>ad Hier. Tom.</i> ii. Fol. 14. after he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
said, “That he gives only that Honour to those Books which are
called <i>Canonical</i>, as to believe that the Authors thereof did in Writing
not err,” he adds, “And if I shall meet with any Thing in
these Writings that seemeth repugnant to Truth, I shall not doubt
to say, that either the Volume is faulty or erroneous; that the Expounder
hath not reached what was said; or that I have in no
wise understood it.” So that he supposes that in the Transcription
and Translation there may be Errors.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be then asked me, <i>Whether I think hereby to render the
Scriptures altogether uncertain, or useless?</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; Not at all. The Proposition itself declares how much
I esteem them; and provided that to the Spirit from which they came
be but granted that Place the Scriptures themselves give it, I do freely
concede to the Scriptures the second Place, even whatsoever they say
of themselves; which the Apostle <i>Paul</i> chiefly mentions in two Places,
<i>Rom.</i> xv. 4. <i>Whatsoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our
Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have
Hope.</i> 2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17. <i>The Holy Scriptures are able to make wise
unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Jesus Christ. All Scripture given
by Inspiration of God, is profitable for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,
that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto every
good Work.</i></p>

<p>For though God doth principally and chiefly lead us by his Spirit,
yet he sometimes conveys his Comfort and Consolation to us through
his Children, whom he raises up and inspires to speak or write a
Word in Season,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Saints mutual Comfort is the same Spirit in all.</i></span>whereby the Saints are made Instruments in the
Hand of the Lord to strengthen and encourage one another, which
doth also tend to perfect and make them wise unto Salvation; and
such as are led by the Spirit cannot neglect, but do naturally love,
and are wonderfully cherished by, that which proceedeth from the
same Spirit in another; because such mutual Emanations of the
heavenly Life tend to quicken the Mind, when at any Time it is overtaken
with Heaviness. <i>Peter</i> himself declares this to have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
End of his Writing, 2 <i>Pet.</i> i. 12, 13. <i>Wherefore I will not be negligent
to put you always in Remembrance of these Things, though ye know them, and
be established in the present Truth; yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in
this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance.</i></p>

<p>God is Teacher of his People himself; and there is nothing more
express, than that such as are under the New Covenant, <i>need no Man
to teach them</i>: Yet it was a Fruit of Christ’s Ascension to send Teachers
and Pastors for perfecting of the Saints. So that the same Work
is ascribed to the Scriptures as to Teachers; the one to make the
Man of God perfect, the other for the Perfection of the Saints.</p>

<p>As then Teachers are not to go before the teaching of God himself
under the New Covenant, but to follow after it; neither are they
to rob us of that great Privilege which Christ hath purchased unto
us by his <i>Blood</i>; so neither is the Scripture to go before the teaching
of the Spirit, or to rob us of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, God hath seen meet that herein we should,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Scriptures a Looking-Glass.</i></span>as in a Looking-Glass,
see the Conditions and Experiences of the Saints of old;
that finding our Experience answer to theirs, we might thereby be
the more confirmed and comforted, and our Hope of obtaining the
same End strengthened; that observing the Providences attending
them, seeing the Snares they were liable to, and beholding their
Deliverances, we may thereby be made wise unto Salvation, and seasonably
reproved and instructed in Righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Scriptures Work and Service.</i></span>This is the great Work of the Scriptures, and their Service to us,
that we may witness them fulfilled <i>in</i> us, and so discern the Stamp
of God’s Spirit and Ways upon them, by the inward Acquaintance
we have with the same Spirit and Work in our Hearts. The Prophecies
of the Scriptures are also very comfortable and profitable
unto us, as the same Spirit enlightens us to observe them fulfilled,
and to be fulfilled; for in all this it is to be observed, that it is only
the Spiritual Man that can make a right Use of them: They are able
to make the Man of God perfect (so it is not the Natural Man) and
whatsoever was written aforetime, was written for <i>our Comfort</i>, [<i>our</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
that are the Believers, [<i>our</i>] that are the Saints; concerning such the
Apostle speaks: For as for the others, the Apostle <i>Peter</i> plainly declares,
that the <i>Unstable and Unlearned wrest them to their own Destruction</i>:
These were they that were unlearned in the Divine and Heavenly
Learning of the Spirit, not in Human and School Literature; in
which we may safely presume that <i>Peter</i> himself, being a Fisherman,
had no Skill; for it may with great Probability, yea Certainty, be
affirmed,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Logick.</i></span>that he had no Knowledge of <i>Aristotle</i>’s Logick, which both
<i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> now,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> degenerating from the Simplicity of Truth,
make the Handmaid of Divinity, as they call it, and a necessary Introduction
to their carnal, natural, and human Ministry. By the
infinite obscure Labours of which Kind of Men, intermixing their
Heathenish Stuff, the Scripture is rendered at this Day of so little Service
to the simple People: Whereof if <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Jerom"><i>Jerome</i></span> complained in his Time,
now twelve Hundred Years ago, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Hierom."><i>Jerome</i></span> Epist. 134. <i>ad Cypr.</i> Tom. 3.
saying, <i>It is wont to befal the most Part of learned Men, that it is harder to
understand their Expositions, than the Things which they go about to expound</i>:
what may we say now, considering those great Heaps of Commentaries
since, in Ages yet far more corrupted?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Scriptures a Secondary Rule.</i></span>In this Respect above-mentioned then we have shewn what
Service and Use the Holy Scriptures, as managed in and by the
Spirit, are of to the Church of God; wherefore we do account them
a Secondary Rule. Moreover, because they are commonly acknowledged
by all to have been written by the Dictates of the Holy Spirit,
and that the Errors which may be supposed by the Injury of Times
to have slipt in, are not such but that there is a sufficient clear Testimony
left to all the Essentials of the Christian Faith; we do look
upon them as the only fit outward judge of Controversies among
Christians; and that whatsoever Doctrine is contrary unto their Testimony,
may therefore justly be rejected as false. And for our Parts,
we are very willing that all our Doctrines and Practices be tried by
them; which we never refused, nor ever shall, in all Controversies
with our Adversaries, as the judge and Test. We shall also be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
willing to admit it as a positive certain Maxim, <i>That whatsoever any
do, pretending to the Spirit, which is contrary to the Scriptures, be accounted
and reckoned a Delusion of the Devil</i>. For as we never lay claim to the
Spirit’s Leadings, that we may cover ourselves in any Thing that is
evil; so we know, that as every Evil contradicts the Scriptures, so
it doth also the Spirit in the first Place, from which the Scriptures
came, and whose Motions can never contradict one another, though
they may appear sometimes to be contradictory to the blind Eye of the
natural Man, as <i>Paul</i> and <i>James</i> seem to contradict one another.</div>

<p>Thus far we have shewn both what we believe, and what we believe
not, concerning the Holy Scriptures, hoping we have given
them their due Place. But since they that will needs have them to
be the only, certain, and principal Rule, want not some Shew of
Arguments, even from the Scripture itself (though it no where calls
itself so) by which they labour to prove their Doctrine; I shall briefly
lay them down by Way of Objections, and answer them, before I
make an End of this Matter.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>Their first Objection is usually drawn from <i>Isaiah</i> viii.
20. <i>To the Law and to the Testimony; if they speak not according to this Word,
it is because there is no Light in them.</i> Now this <i>Law</i>, <i>Testimony</i>, and
<i>Word</i>, they plead to be the Scriptures.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>To which I answer; That that is to beg the Thing in Question,
and remains yet unproved. Nor do I know for what Reason we may
not safely affirm this <i>Law</i> and <i>Word</i> to be <i>Inward</i>: But suppose it was
<i>Outward</i>, it proves not the Case at all for them, neither makes it
against us; for it may be confessed, without any Prejudice to our
Cause, that the outward Law was more particularly to the <i>Jews</i> a
Rule, and more principally than to us; seeing their Law was outward
and literal, but ours, under the New Covenant (as hath been
already said) is expresly affirmed to be <i>Inward</i> and <i>Spiritual</i>; so that
this Scripture is so far from making against us, that it makes for us.
<span class="sidenote"><i>To try all Things, by what?</i></span>For if the <i>Jews</i> were directed to try all Things by their Law, which
was without them, written in Tables of Stone; then if we will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
this Advice of the Prophet to reach us, we must make it hold parallel
to that Dispensation of the Gospel which we are under: So that we
are to try all Things, in the first Place, by that <i>Word of Faith</i> which
is preached unto us, which the Apostle saith is <i>in the Heart</i>; and by
that Law which God hath given us, which the Apostle saith also expresly
<i>is written and placed in the Mind</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, If we look to this Place according to the <i>Greek</i> Interpretation
of the <i>Septuagint</i>, our Adversaries shall have nothing from thence to
carp; yea, it will favour us much; for there it is said, that <i>the Law
is given us for an Help</i>; which very well agrees with what is above
asserted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>Their second Objection is from <i>John</i> v. 39. <i>Search the Scriptures</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Here, </i>say they<i>, we are commanded, </i>by Christ himself<i>, to search the
Scriptures.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>I answer, <i>First</i>, That the Scriptures ought to be searched, we do
not at all deny; but are very willing to be tried by them, as hath
been above declared: But the Question is, <i>Whether they be the Only and
Principal Rule?</i> Which this is so far from proving, that it proveth the
contrary;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Search the Scripture</i>, &amp;c.</span>for Christ checks them here for too high an Esteem of the
Scriptures, and neglecting of him that was to be preferred before
them, and to whom they bore Witness, as the following Words declare;
<i>For in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which
testify of me: and ye will not come unto me, that ye might have Life.</i> This
shews, that while they thought they had Eternal Life in the Scriptures,
they neglected to come unto Christ to have Life, of which the
Scriptures bore witness. This answers well to our Purpose, since
our Adversaries now do also exalt the Scriptures, and think to have
Life in them; which is no more than to look upon them as the only
principal Rule and Way to Life, and yet refuse to come unto the
Spirit of which they testify, even the inward spiritual Law, which
could give them Life: So that the Cause of this People’s Ignorance
and Unbelief was not their Want of Respect to the Scriptures, which
though they knew, and had an high Esteem of, yet Christ testifies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
the former Verses, that they had neither <i>seen the Father, nor heard his
Voice at any Time; neither had his Word abiding in them</i>; which had they
then had, then they had believed in the Son.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span>Moreover, that Place
may be taken in the Indicative Mood, <i>Ye search the Scriptures</i>; which
Interpretation the <i>Greek</i> Word will bear, and so <i>Pasor</i> translateth it:
Which by the Reproof following, seemeth also to be the more genuine
Interpretation, as <i>Cyrillus</i> long ago hath observed.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span>Their third Objection is from these Words, <i>Acts</i> xvii. 11.
<i>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the
Word with all Readiness of Mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether
those Things were so.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span><i>Here, </i>say they<i>, the </i>Bereans<i> are commended for searching the Scriptures,
and making them the Rule.</i></p>

<p>I answer; That the Scriptures either are the principal or only
Rule, will not at all follow from this; neither will their searching
the Scriptures, or being commended for it, infer any such Thing:
For we recommend and approve the Use of them in that Respect as
much as any; yet will it not follow, that we affirm them to be the
principal and only Rule.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, It is to be observed that these were the <i>Jews</i> of <i>Berea</i>, to
whom these Scriptures, which were the Law and the Prophets, were
more particularly a Rule;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> Bereans <i>searching the Scriptures, makes them not the only Rule to try Doctrines.</i></span>and the Thing under Examination was,
whether the Birth, Life, Works, and Sufferings of Christ, did answer
to the Prophecies concerning him; so that it was most proper
for them, being <i>Jews</i>, to examine the Apostle’s Doctrine by the
Scriptures; seeing he pleaded it to be a fulfilling of them. It is said
nevertheless, in the first Place, That <i>they received the Word with Chearfulness</i>;
and in the second Place, <i>They searched the Scriptures</i>: Not that
they searched the Scriptures, and then received the Word; for then
could they not have prevailed to convert them, had they not first
minded the <i>Word abiding in them</i>, which opened their Understandings;
no more than the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, who (as in the former Objection
we observed) searched the Scriptures, and exalted them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
yet remained in their Unbelief, because they had not the <i>Word
abiding in them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 3.</i></span>But <i>Lastly</i>, If this Commendation of the <i>Jewish Bereans</i> might infer
that the Scriptures were the only and principal Rule to try the Apostle’s
Doctrine by, what should have become of the <i>Gentiles</i>? How
should they ever have come to have received the Faith of Christ, who
neither knew the Scriptures, nor believed them?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Athenians<i> instanced.</i></span>We see in the End
of the same Chapter, how the Apostle, preaching to the <i>Athenians</i>,
took another Method, and directed them to somewhat of <i>God within</i>
themselves, that they might <i>feel after him</i>. He did not go about to
proselyte them to the <i>Jewish Religion</i>, and to the Belief of the <i>Law</i>
and the <i>Prophets</i>, and from thence to prove the coming of Christ;
nay, he took a nearer Way. Now certainly the principal and only
Rule is not different; one to the <i>Jews</i>, and another to the <i>Gentiles</i>;
but is <i>Universal</i>, reaching both: Though secondary and subordinate
Rules and Means may be various, and diversly suited, according as
the People they are used to are stated and circumstanced: Even so
we see that the Apostle to the <i>Athenians</i> used a Testimony of one of
their own Poets, which he judged would have Credit with them;
and no doubt such Testimonies, whose Authors they esteemed, had
more Weight with them than all the Sayings of <i>Moses</i> and the <i>Prophets</i>,
whom they neither knew nor would have cared for. Now because
the Apostle used the Testimony of a Poet to the <i>Athenians</i>, will
it therefore follow, he made that the principal or only Rule to try his
Doctrine by? So neither will it follow, that though he made use of
the Scriptures to the <i>Jews</i>, as being a Principle already believed by
them, to try his Doctrine, that from thence the Scriptures may be
accounted the principal or only Rule.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3> The last, and that which at first View seems to be the
greatest Objection, is this:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span><i>If the Scripture be not the adequate, principal, and only Rule, then it
would follow that the Scripture is not complete, nor the Canon filled; that if
Men be now immediately led and ruled by the Spirit, they may add new Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
of equal Authority with the Old; whereas every one that adds is cursed:
Yea, what Assurance have we, but at this Rate every one may bring in a new
Gospel according to his Fancy?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>The dangerous Consequences insinuated in this Objection were
fully answered in the latter Part of the last Proposition, in what was
said a little before, offering freely to disclaim all pretended Revelations
contrary to the Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>But if it be urged, <i>That it is not enough to deny these Consequences, if
they naturally follow from your Doctrine of Immediate Revelation, and denying
the Scripture to be the only Rule</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>I answer; We have proved both these Doctrines to be true and
necessary, according to the Scriptures themselves; and therefore to
fasten evil Consequences upon them, which we make appear do not
follow, is not to accuse us, but Christ and his Apostles, who preached
them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span>But <i>Secondly</i>, We have shut the Door upon all such Doctrine in
this very Position; affirming, <i>That the Scriptures give a full and ample
Testimony to all the principal Doctrines of the Christian Faith</i>. For we do
firmly believe that there is no other Gospel or Doctrine to be preached,
but that which was delivered by the Apostles; and do freely subscribe
to that Saying, <a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><i>Let him that preacheth any other Gospel, than that
which hath been already preached by the Apostles, and according to the Scriptures,
be accursed</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Gal. i. 8.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>A new Revelation is not a new Gospel.</i></span>So we distinguish betwixt a Revelation of a <i>new Gospel</i>, and <i>new Doctrines</i>,
and a <i>new Revelation</i> of the <i>good old Gospel</i> and <i>Doctrines</i>; the last
we plead for, but the first we utterly deny. For we firmly believe,
That <i>no other Foundation can any Man lay, than that which is laid already</i>.
But that this Revelation is necessary we have already proved; and
this Distinction doth sufficiently guard us against the Hazard insinuated
in the Objection.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Books Canonical.</i></span>As to the <i>Scriptures</i> being a <i>filled Canon</i>, I see no Necessity of believing
it.
And if these Men, that believe the Scriptures to be the
only Rule, will be consistent with their own Doctrine, they must needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
be of my Judgment; seeing it is simply impossible to prove the Canon
by the Scriptures. For it cannot be found in any Book of the
Scriptures, that these Books, and just these, and no other, are Canonical,
as all are forced to acknowledge; how can they then evite
this Argument?</p>

<p>That which cannot be proved by Scripture is no necessary Article
of Faith.</p>

<p>But the Canon of the Scripture; to wit, that there are so many
Books precisely, neither more <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: or">nor</span> less, cannot be proved by Scripture:</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, it is no necessary Article of Faith.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>If they should allege; <i>That the admitting of any other Books to be now
written by the same Spirit might infer the Admission of new Doctrines</i>:</p>

<p>I deny that Consequence; for the Principal or Fundamental Doctrines
of the Christian Religion are contained in the tenth Part of
the Scripture; but it will not follow thence that the Rest are impertinent,
or useless.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Books lost.</i></span>If it should please God to bring to us any of those
Books, which by the Injury of Time are lost, which are mentioned
in the Scripture; as, <i>The Prophecy of</i> Enoch, <i>the Book of</i> Nathan, <i>&amp;c.</i>
or, <i>the Third Epistle of </i>Paul<i> to the</i> Corinthians; I see no Reason why we
ought not to receive them, and place them with the Rest. That which
displeaseth me is, that Men should first affirm that the Scripture is
the only and principal Rule, and yet make that a great Article of
Faith into which the Scripture can give us no Light.</p>

<p>As for Instance: How shall a <i>Protestant</i> prove by Scripture, to such
as deny the Epistle of <i>James</i> to be authentick, that it ought to be
received?</p>

<p><i>First</i>, If he would say, <i>Because it contradicts not the Rest</i>, (besides
that there is no Mention of it in any of the Rest) perhaps these Men
think it doth contradict <i>Paul</i> in Relation to <i>Faith</i> and <i>Works</i>. But,
if that should be granted, it would as well follow, that every Writer
that contradicts not the Scripture, should be put into the Canon; and
by this Means these Men fall into a greater Absurdity than they fix upon
us: For thus they would equal every one the Writings of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
Sect with the Scriptures; for I suppose they judge their own Confession
of Faith doth not contradict the Scriptures: Will it therefore
follow that it should be bound up with the Bible? And yet it seems
impossible, according to their Principles, to bring any better Argument
to prove the Epistle of <i>James</i> to be Authentick.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether the Epistle of </i>James<i> be authentick, and how to know it?</i></span>There is then
this unavoidable Necessity to say, We know it by the same Spirit from
which it was written; or otherwise to step back to <i>Rome</i>, and say, We
know by Tradition that the Church hath declared it to be Canonical;
and the Church is Infallible. Let them find a Mean, if they can.
So that out of this Objection we shall draw an unanswerable Argument
<i>ad Hominem</i>, to our Purpose.</p>

<p>That which cannot assure me concerning an Article of Faith necessary
to be believed, is not the primary, adequate, only Rule of
Faith, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I prove the Assumption thus:</p>

<p>That which cannot assure me concerning the Canon of the Scripture,
to wit, that such Books are only to be admitted, and the <i>Apocrypha</i>
excluded, cannot assure me of this:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span>And <i>Lastly</i>, As to these Words, <i>Rev.</i> xxii. 18. <i>That if any Man shall
add unto these Things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in
this Book</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I desire they will shew me how it relates to any Thing else
than to that particular Prophecy. It saith not, <i>Now the Canon of the
Scripture is filled up, no Man is to write more from the Spirit</i>; yea, do not
all confess that there have been Prophecies and true Prophets since?
The <i>Papists</i> deny it not. And do not the <i>Protestants</i> affirm, that <i>John
Hus</i> prophesied of the <i>Reformation?</i> Was he therefore cursed? Or did
he therein Evil? I could give many other Examples, confessed by
themselves.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What it means to add to the Scriptures.</i></span>But, moreover, the same was in Effect commanded long
before, <i>Prov.</i> xxx. 6. <i>Add thou not unto his Words, lest he reprove thee,
and thou be found a Liar</i>: Yet how many Books of the Prophets were
written after? And the same was said by <i>Moses</i>, Deut. iv. 2. <i>Ye shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
not add unto the Word which I command you; neither shall ye diminish aught
from it.</i> So that, though we should extend that of the <i>Revelation</i> beyond
the particular Prophecy of that Book, it cannot be understood
but of a new Gospel, or new Doctrines, or of restraining Man’s Spirit,
that he mix not his Human Words with the Divine; and not of
<i>a new Revelation of the Old</i>, as we have said before.</p>

<p class="chapter-head"><i>All </i>Adam<i>’s Posterity, or Mankind, both </i>Jews<i> and </i>Gentiles<i>, as
to the first </i>Adam<i>, or Earthly Man, is fallen, degenerated, and
dead; deprived of the Sensation or Feeling of this </i>Inward Testimony<i>
or Seed of God; </i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><i>and is subject unto the Power, Nature,
and Seed of the Serpent, which he soweth in Men’s Hearts, while
they abide in this natural and corrupted Estate: From whence it
comes, that not only their Words and Deeds, but all their Imaginations,
are Evil perpetually in the Sight of God, as proceeding
from this depraved and wicked Seed. Man therefore, as he is
in this State, can know Nothing aright; yea, his Thoughts and
Conceptions concerning God and Things </i>Spiritual<i>, until he be disjoined
from this Evil Seed, and united to the </i>Divine Light<i>, are
unprofitable both to himself and others. Hence are rejected the </i>Socinian<i>

also of the </i>Papists<i>, and most </i>Protestants<i>, who affirm, </i>That

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> Hitherto we have discoursed how the True Knowledge
of God is attained and preserved; also of what Use and
Service the Holy Scripture is to the Saints.</div>

<p>We come now to examine <i>the State and Condition of Man as he stands
in the Fall</i>; <i>what his Capacity and Power is</i>; <i>and how far he is able, as of
himself, to advance in Relation to the Things of God</i>. Of this we touched
a little in the Beginning of the second Proposition; but the full,
right, and thorough Understanding of it is of great Use and Service;
because from the Ignorance and Altercations that have been about
it, there have arisen great and dangerous Errors, both on the one
Hand and on the other. While some do so far exalt the Light of Nature,
or the Faculty of the Natural Man, as capable of himself, by Virtue
of the inward Will, Faculty, Light and Power, that pertains to his
Nature, to follow that which is good, and make real Progress towards
Heaven. And of these are the <i>Pelagians</i>, and <i>Semi-Pelagians</i> of
Old; and of late the <i>Socinians</i>, and divers others among the <i>Papists</i>.
Others again will needs run into another Extreme,
<span class="sidenote">Augustine’s <i>Zeal against Pelagius</i>.</span>(to whom <i>Augustine</i>,
among the Ancients, first made Way in his declining Age,
through the Heat of his Zeal against <i>Pelagius</i>) not only confessing Man
uncapable of himself to do Good, and prone to Evil; but that in his
very Mother’s Womb, and before he commits any actual Transgression,
he is contaminate with a real Guilt, whereby he deserves eternal Death:
In which Respect they are not afraid to affirm, <i>That many poor Infants
are Eternally Damned, and for ever endure the Torments of Hell</i>. Therefore
the God of Truth, having now again revealed his Truth (that
good and even Way) by his own Spirit, hath taught us to avoid
both these Extremes.</p>

<p>That then which our Proposition leads to treat of is,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">I.</span>First, <i>What the Condition of Man is in the Fall; and how far uncapable to
meddle in the Things of God</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">II.</span>And Secondly, <i>That God doth not impute this Evil to Infants, until they
actually join with it</i>: That so, by Establishing the Truth, we may overturn
the Errors on both Parts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">III.</span>And, as for that Third Thing included in the Proposition itself
concerning these <i>Teachers</i> which <i>want the Grace of God</i>, we shall refer
that to the tenth Proposition, where the Matter is more particularly
handled.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Part I. <i>Adam’s Fall.</i></span>As to the first, not to dive into the many curious Notions
which many have concerning the <i>Condition of</i> Adam <i>before the Fall</i>, all
agree in this, That thereby he came to a very great Loss, not only
in the Things which related to the outward Man, but in Regard to
that true Fellowship and Communion he had with God. This Loss
was signified unto him in the Command, <i>For in the Day thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt surely die</i>, Gen. ii. 17. This Death could not be an
outward Death, or the Dissolution of the outward Man; for as to
that, he did not die yet many Hundred Years after; so that it must
needs respect his spiritual Life and Communion with God. The
Consequence of this Fall, besides that which relates to the Fruits of
the Earth, is also expressed, <i>Gen.</i> iii. 24. <i>So he drove out the Man, and
he placed at the East of the Garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming Sword,
which turned every Way, to keep the Way of the Tree of Life.</i> Now whatsoever
literal Signification this may have, we may safely ascribe to
this Paradise a mystical Signification, and truly account it that spiritual
Communion and Fellowship, which the Saints obtain with God
by Jesus Christ; to whom only these Cherubims give Way, and unto
as many as enter by him, who calls himself the <i>Door</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Guilt not ascribed to </i>Adam<i>’s Posterity.</i></span>So that,
though we do not ascribe any Whit of <i>Adam</i>’s Guilt to Men, until
they make it theirs by the like Acts of Disobedience; yet we cannot
suppose that Men, who are come of <i>Adam</i> naturally, can have any
good Thing in their Nature, as belonging to it; which he, from
whom they derive their Nature, had not himself to communicate
unto them.</div>

<p>If then we may affirm, that <i>Adam</i> did not retain in his Nature (as
belonging thereunto) any Will or Light capable to give him Knowledge
in spiritual Things, then neither can his Posterity: For whatsoever
real Good any Man doth, it proceedeth not from his Nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
as he is Man, or the Son of <i>Adam</i>; but from the <i>Seed of God in him</i>,
as a new Visitation of Life, in order to bring him out of this natural
Condition: So that, though it be <i>in him</i>, yet it is not <i>of him</i>; and
this the Lord himself witnessed, <i>Gen.</i> vi. 5. where it is said, he <i>saw
that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually</i>:
Which Words as they are very positive, so are they very comprehensive.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Every Imagination of the natural Man is evil.</i></span>Observe the Emphasis of them; <i>First, </i>There<i> is every Imagination
of the Thoughts of his Heart</i>; so that this admits of no Exception of any
Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart. <i>Secondly, Is only evil continually</i>;
it is neither in <i>some Part evil continually</i>, nor yet <i>only</i> evil <i>at
some Times</i>; but both <i>only</i> evil, and <i>always</i> and <i>continually</i> evil; which
certainly excludes any Good, as a proper Effect of Man’s Heart, naturally:
For that which is only evil, and that always, cannot of its
own Nature produce any good Thing. The Lord expressed this again
a little after, Chap. viii. 21. <i>The Imagination of Man’s Heart is evil from
his Youth.</i> Thus inferring how natural and proper it is unto him;
from which I thus argue:</p>

<p>If the Thoughts of Man’s Heart be not only evil, but always evil;
then are they, as they simply proceed from his Heart, neither good
in Part, nor at any Time:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore the Last.</p>

<p class="in4">Again,</p>

<p>If Man’s Thoughts be always and only evil, then are they altogether
useless and ineffectual to him in the Things of God:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore the Last.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Heart of Man deceitful.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This appears clearly from that Saying of the Prophet <i>Jeremiah</i>,
Chap. xvii. 9. <i>The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately
wicked.</i> For who can with any Colour of Reason imagine, that
that which is so hath any Power of itself, or is in any wise fit, to
lead a Man to Righteousness, whereunto it is of its own Nature directly
opposite? This is as contrary to Reason, as it is impossible in
Nature, that a Stone of its own Nature and proper Motion, should
fly upwards: For as a Stone of its own Nature inclineth and is prone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
to move downwards towards the Center, so the Heart of Man is naturally
prone and inclined to Evil, some to one, and some to another.
From this then I also thus argue:</p>

<p>That which is <i>deceitful above all Things, and desperately wicked</i>, is not
fit, neither can it lead a Man aright in Things that are good and
honest.</p>

<p>But the Heart of Man is such:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>But the Apostle <i>Paul</i> describeth the Condition of Men in the Fall
at large, taking it out of the <i>Psalmist</i>. <i>There is none righteous, no not
one; There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
They are all gone out of the Way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there
is none that doth good, no not one.</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Man’s Estate
in the Fall.</i></span> <i>Their Throat is an open Sepulchre, with
their Tongues they have used Deceit, the Poison of Asps is under their Lips:
Whose Mouths are full of Cursing and Bitterness. Their Feet are swift to shed
Blood; Destruction and Misery are in their Ways: And the Way of Peace have
they not known. There is no Fear of God before their Eyes.</i> What more
positive can be spoken? He seemeth to be particularly careful to
avoid that any Good should be ascribed to the natural Man; he
shews how he is polluted in all his Ways; he shews how he is void of
Righteousness, of Understanding, of the Knowledge of God; how he
is out of the Way, and in short unprofitable; than which nothing
can be more fully said to confirm our Judgment: For if this be the
Condition of the natural Man, or of the Man as he stands in the
Fall, he is unfit to make one right Step to Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>That is not spoken of the Condition of Man in general; but
only of some Particulars, or at the least that it comprehends not all</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>The Text sheweth the clear Contrary in the foregoing Verses,
where the Apostle takes in himself, as he stood in his natural Condition.
<i>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have
before proved both </i>Jews<i> and </i>Gentiles<i>, that they are all under Sin, as it is
written</i>: And so he goes on; by which it is manifest that he speaks
of Mankind in general.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If they object that which the same Apostle saith in the foregoing
Chapter, Ver. 14. to wit, That <i>the </i>Gentiles<i> do by Nature the Things
contained in the Law, and so consequently do by Nature that which is good
and acceptable in the Sight of God</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>I answer; This Nature must not, neither can be understood of
<i>Man’s own Nature</i>, which is corrupt and fallen; but of the <i>Spiritual
Nature</i>, which proceedeth from the <i>Seed of God in Man</i>, as it receiveth
a new Visitation of God’s Love, and is quickened by it: Which
clearly appears by the following Words, where he saith,
<span class="sidenote"><i>By what Nature the </i>Gentiles<i> did do the Things of the Law.</i></span><i>These not
having a Law, </i>(i. e. outwardly)<i> are a Law unto themselves; which shews
the Work of the Law written in their Hearts</i>. These Acts of theirs then
are an Effect of the Law written in their Hearts; but the Scripture
declareth, that the Writing of the Law in the Heart is a Part, yea,
and a great Part too, of the New Covenant Dispensation, and so no
Consequence nor Part of Man’s Nature.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, If this Nature here spoken of could be understood of Man’s
own Nature, which he hath as he is a Man, then would the Apostle
unavoidably contradict himself; since he elsewhere positively declares,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The natural Man discerneth not</i>, &amp;c.</span><i>That the natural Man discerneth not the Things of God, nor can</i>. Now I
hope the Law of God is among the Things of God, especially as it is
written in the Heart. The Apostle, in the viith Chap. of the same
Epistle, saith, Ver. 12. that <i>the Law is, Holy, Just, and Good</i>; and
Ver. 14. the <i>Law is Spiritual, but he is Carnal</i>. Now in what Respect
is he Carnal, but as he stands in the Fall unregenerate? Now what
Inconsistency would here be, to say, That he is Carnal, and yet not
so of his own Nature, seeing it is from his Nature that he is so denominated?
We see the Apostle contra-distinguisheth the Law as
Spiritual, from Man’s Nature as Carnal and Sinful. Wherefore, as
Christ saith, <a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a><i>There can no Grapes be expected from Thorns, nor Figs of
Thistles</i>; so neither can the fulfilling of the Law, which is Spiritual,
Holy, and Just, be expected from that Nature which is Corrupt,
Fallen, and Unregenerate. Whence we conclude, with good Reason,
that the Nature here spoken of, by which the <i>Gentiles</i> are said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
have done the <i>Things contained in the Law</i>, is not the <i>common Nature of
Men</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Gentiles<i> Spiritual Nature in doing the Law.</i></span>but that <i>Spiritual Nature</i> that ariseth from the Works of the
righteous and Spiritual Law that is written in the Heart. I confess
they of the other Extreme, when they are pressed with this Testimony
by the <i>Socinians</i> and <i>Pelagians</i>, as well as by us when we use this
Scripture, to shew them how some of the <i>Heathens</i>, by the <i>Light of
Christ in their Heart, came to be saved, are very far to seek; giving
this Answer</i>, That <i>there were some Reliques of the heavenly Image left in
</i>Adam<i>, by which the </i>Heathens<i> could do some good Things</i>. Which, as it
is in itself without Proof, so it contradicts their own Assertions elsewhere,
and gives away their Cause. For if these Reliques were of
Force to enable them to fulfil the righteous Law of God, it takes
away the Necessity of Christ’s coming; or at least leaves them a Way
to be saved without him; unless they will say (which is worst of all)
<i>That though they really fulfilled the righteous Law of God, yet God damned
them, because of the Want of that particular Knowledge, while he himself with-held
all Means of their coming to him from them</i>; but of this hereafter.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3> I might also here use another Argument from these Words
of the Apostle, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. where he so positively excludes the natural
Man from an Understanding in the Things of God; but because I
have spoken of <i>that Scripture</i> in the Beginning of the second Proposition,
I will here avoid to repeat what is there mentioned, referring
thereunto:
<span class="sidenote">Socinians <i>exalting the Light of the natural Man.</i></span>Yet because the <i>Socinians</i> and others, who exalt the Light
of the natural Man, or a natural Light in Man, do object against
this Scripture, I shall remove it before I proceed.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>They say, <i>The </i>Greek<i> Word </i>[Greek: psychikos: ψυχικος]<i> ought to be translated </i>animal<i>, and
not </i>natural<i>; else, </i>say they<i>, it would have been</i> [Greek: physikos: φυσικος]. From which
they seek to infer, <i>that it is only the Animal Man, and not the Rational,
that is excluded here from discerning the Things of God</i>. Which <i>Shift</i>, without
disputing about the Word, is easily refuted; neither is it any wise
consistent with the Scope of the Place. For</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Animal Life is the same with Natural.</i></span>
<i>First</i>, The <i>Animal Life</i> is no other than that which Man hath in
common with other living Creatures; for as he is a mere Man, he
differs no otherwise from Beasts than by the <i>Rational Property</i>. Now
the Apostle deduceth his Argument in the foregoing Verses from this
<i>Simile</i>; That <i>as the Things of a Man cannot be known but by the Spirit of
a Man, so the Things of God no Man knoweth but by the Spirit of God</i>. But
I hope these Men will confess unto me, that the Things of a Man
are not known by the <i>Animal Spirit</i> only, <i>i. e.</i> by that which he hath
in common with the Beasts, but by the <i>Rational</i>; so that it must be
the <i>Rational</i> that is here understood. Again, the Assumption shews
clearly that the Apostle had no such Intent as these Men’s Gloss
would make him have, viz. <i>So the Things of God knoweth no Man, but
the Spirit of God</i>. According to their Judgment he should have said,
<i>The Things of God knoweth no Man by his Animal Spirit, but by his Rational
Spirit</i>: For to say, <i>The Spirit of God</i>, here spoken of, is no other than
the <i>Rational Spirit of Man</i>, would border upon Blasphemy, since they
are so often contra-distinguished. Again, going on, he saith not that
they are <i>Rationally</i>, but <i>Spiritually discerned</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, The Apostle throughout this Chapter shews how the Wisdom
of Man is unfit to judge of the Things of God, and ignorant
of them. Now I ask these Men, whether a Man be called a <i>Wise Man</i>
from his <i>Animal Property</i>, or from his <i>Rational</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Rational Man in the Natural State excluded from discerning the Things of God.</i></span>If from his <i>Rational</i>,
then it is not only the <i>Animal</i>, but also the <i>Rational</i>, as he is yet in the
Natural State, which the Apostle excludes here, and whom he contra-distinguisheth
from the Spiritual, Ver. 15. <i>But the Spiritual Man judgeth
all Things.</i> This cannot be said of any Man merely because <i>Rational</i>,
or as he is a Man, seeing the Men of the greatest Reason, if we may
so esteem Men, whom the Scripture calls <i>Wise</i>, as were the <i>Greeks</i> of
Old, not only may be, but often are Enemies to the Kingdom of
God; while both the <i>Preaching of Christ</i> is said to be <i>Foolishness with the
Wise Men of the World</i>, and the <i>Wisdom of the World</i> is said to be <i>Foolishness
with God</i>. Now whether it be any ways probable that either
these Wise Men that are said to account the <i>Gospel Foolishness</i>, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
only so called with respect to their <i>Animal Property</i>, and not their
<i>Rational</i>; or that the <i>Wisdom</i> that is Foolishness with God is not meant
of the <i>Rational</i>, but only the <i>Animal Property</i>, any Rational Man, laying
aside Interest, may easily judge.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> <span class="sidenote">Infants, <i>no Sin imputed to them</i>.</span> I come now to the other Part, to wit, That <i>this evil and corrupt
Seed is not imputed to Infants, until they actually join with it</i>.
For this
there is a Reason given in the End of the Proposition itself, drawn from
<i>Ephes.</i> ii. For these are <i>by Nature Children of Wrath, who walk according
to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children
of Disobedience</i>. Here the Apostle gives their evil walking, and
not any Thing that is not reduced to act, as a Reason of their being
<i>Children of Wrath</i>. And this is suitable to the whole Strain of the
Gospel, where no Man is ever threatened or judged for what Iniquity
he hath not actually wrought: Such indeed as continue in Iniquity,
and so do allow the Sins of their Fathers, God will visit the Iniquity
of the Fathers upon the Children.</div>

<p>Is it not strange then that Men should entertain an Opinion so absurd
in itself, and so cruel and contrary to the Nature as well of God’s
Mercy as Justice, concerning which the Scripture is altogether silent?
But it is manifest that Man hath invented this Opinion out of Self-love,
and from that bitter Root from which all Errors spring;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The absolute Decree of Election springs from Self-love.</i></span>for the
most Part of <i>Protestants</i> that hold this, having, as they fancy, the <i>Absolute
Decree of Election</i> to secure them and their Children, so as they
cannot miss of Salvation, they make no Difficulty to send all others,
both Old and Young, to Hell. For whereas Self-love, which is always
apt to believe that which it desires, possesseth them with an
Hope that their Part is secure, they are not solicitous how they leave
their Neighbours, which are the far greater Part of Mankind, in these
inextricable Difficulties. The <i>Papists</i> again use this Opinion as an
Art to augment the Esteem of their Church, and Reverence of its Sacraments,
seeing they pretend it is washed away by Baptism; only
in this they appear to be a little more merciful, in that they send
not these unbaptized Infants to Hell, but to a certain <i>Limbus</i>, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
which the Scriptures are as silent as of the other. This then
is not only not authorized in the Scriptures, but contrary to the express
Tenor of them. The Apostle saith plainly, <i>Rom.</i> iv. 15. <i>Where no
Law is, there is no Transgression.</i> And again, v. 13. <i>But Sin is not imputed,
where there is no Law.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>To Infants there is no Law so no Transgression.</i></span>Than which Testimonies there is nothing
more positive; since to Infants there is no Law, seeing as such
they are utterly uncapable of it; the Law cannot reach any but such
as have in some Measure less or more the Exercise of their Understanding,
which Infants have not. So that from thence I thus argue:</p>

<p>Sin is imputed to none, where there is no Law.</p>

<p>But to Infants there is no Law:</p>

<p>Therefore Sin is not imputed to them.</p>

<p>The <i>Proposition</i> is the Apostle’s own Words; the <i>Assumption</i> is thus
proved:</p>

<p>Those who are under a Physical Impossibility of either hearing,
knowing, or understanding any Law, where the Impossibility is not
brought upon them by any Act of their own, but is according to
the very Order of Nature appointed by God; to such there is no
Law.</p>

<p>But Infants are under this Physical Impossibility:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, What can be more positive than that of <i>Ezek.</i> xviii. 20.
<i>The Soul that sinneth, it shall die: The Son shall not bear the Father’s Iniquity?</i>
For the Prophet here first sheweth what is the Cause of Man’s Eternal
Death, which he saith is his <i>Sinning</i>; and then, as if he purposed
expresly to shut out such an Opinion, he assures us, <i>The Son shall not
bear the Father’s Iniquity</i>. From which I thus argue:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Infants bear not </i>Adam<i>’s Transgression.</i></span>If the Son bear not the Iniquity of his Father, or of his immediate
Parents, far less shall he bear the Iniquity of <i>Adam</i>.</p>

<p>But the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his Father:</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, &amp;c.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3> Having thus far shewn how absurd this Opinion is, I shall
briefly examine the Reasons its Authors bring for it.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span><i>First, </i>They say, Adam<i> was a publick Person, and therefore all Men sinned

v. 12. <i>Wherefore as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by
Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned, </i>&amp;c.<i> These
last Words, </i>say they,<i> may be translated, In whom all have sinned.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>To this I answer: That <i>Adam</i> is a publick Person is not denied;
and that through him there is a Seed of Sin propagated to all Men,
which in its own Nature is sinful, and inclines Men to Iniquity; yet
it will not follow from thence, that Infants, who join not with this
Seed, are guilty. As for these Words in the <i>Romans</i>, the Reason of
the Guilt there alleged is, <i>For that all have sinned</i>. Now no Man is
said to sin, unless he actually sin in his own Person; for the <i>Greek</i>
Words [Greek: eph' ô: εφ ω] may very well relate to [Greek: thanatos: θανατος], which is the nearest
Antecedent; so that they hold forth, how that <i>Adam</i>, by his Sin,
gave an Entrance to Sin in the World; <i>And so Death entered by Sin</i>, [Greek: eph'
ô: εφ ω] i. e. <i>upon which</i> [viz. Occasion] or, <i>in which</i> [viz. Death] <i>all</i> others
<i>have sinned</i>; that is, actually in their own Persons; to wit, all that
were capable of sinning: Of which Number that Infants could not
be, the Apostle clearly shews by the following Verse, <i>Sin is not imputed,
where there is no Law</i>: And since, as is above proved, there is
no Law to Infants, they cannot be here included.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>Their Second Objection is from <i>Psalm</i> li. 5. <i>Behold I was shapen in
Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me. Hence, </i>they say,<i> it appears
that Infants from their Conception are guilty.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>
How they infer this Consequence, for my Part I see not.
The Iniquity and Sin here appears to be far more ascribable to the Parents
than to the Child.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Conceived in Sin</i> answered.</span>It is said indeed, <i>In Sin did my Mother conceive
me</i>; not <i>my Mother did conceive me a Sinner</i>. Besides that, so interpreted,
contradicts expresly the Scripture before-mentioned in
making Children guilty of the Sins of their immediate Parents, (for
of <i>Adam</i> there is not here any Mention) contrary to the plain Words,
<i>The Son shall not bear the Father’s Iniquity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span>Thirdly, They object, <i>That the Wages of Sin is Death; and that seeing
Children are subject to Diseases and Death, therefore they must be guilty of
Sin.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; That these Things are a Consequence of the Fall, and
of Adam’s Sin, is confessed; but that that infers necessarily a Guilt in
all others that are subject to them is denied.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Death the Wages of Sin</i> answered.</span>For though the Whole
outward <i>Creation</i> suffered a Decay by <i>Adam</i>’s Fall, which groans under
Vanity; according to which it is said in <i>Job</i>, That <i>the Heavens are
not clean in the Sight of God</i>; yet will it not from thence follow, that
the Herbs, Earth, and Trees are Sinners.</p>

<p>Next, Death, though a Consequent of the Fall, incident to Man’s
earthly Nature, is not the Wages of Sin in the Saints, but rather a
Sleep, by which they pass from Death to Life; which is so far from
being troublesome and painful to them, as all real Punishments for
Sin are, that the Apostle counts it Gain: <i>To me, </i>saith he,<i> to die is
Gain</i>, <i>Philip.</i> i. 21.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span>Some are so foolish as to make an Objection farther, saying, <i>That
if </i>Adam<i>’s Sin be not imputed to those who actually have not sinned, then it
would follow that all Infants are saved</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span> But we are willing that this supposed Absurdity should be the
Consequence of our Doctrine, rather than that which it seems our
Adversaries reckon not absurd, though the undoubted and unavoidable
Consequence of theirs, <i>viz.</i> That <i>many Infants eternally perish, not
for any Sin of their own, but only for </i>Adam<i>’s Iniquity;</i> where we are willing
to let the Controversy stop, commending both to the illuminated
Understanding of the <i>Christian Reader</i>.</p>

<p>This Error of our Adversaries is both denied and refuted by <i>Zuinglius,</i>
that eminent Founder of the <i>Protestant Churches of Switzerland</i>,
in his Book <i>De Baptismo</i>, for which he is anathematized by the Council
of <i>Trent</i>, in the <i>Fifth Session</i>. We shall only add this Information:
That we confess then that a Seed of Sin is transmitted to all Men
from <i>Adam</i>, although imputed to none, until by sinning they actually
join with it; in which Seed he gave Occasion to all to sin, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
the Origin of all evil Actions and Thoughts in Men’s Hearts, [Greek: eph' ô: εφ ω]
to wit, [Greek: thanatô: θανατω], as it is in <i>Rom.</i> v. i. e. <i>In which Death all have sinned.</i>
For this Seed of Sin is frequently called <i>Death</i> in the Scripture, and
<i>the Body of Death</i>; seeing indeed it is a <i>Death</i> to the Life of Righteousness
and Holiness: Therefore its Seed and its Product is called
the <i>Old Man</i>, the <i>Old Adam</i>, in which all Sin is; for <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: which we">which cause we</span> use this
Name to express this Sin, and not that of <i>Original Sin</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Original Sin no Scripture Phrase.</i></span>of which
Phrase the Scripture makes no Mention, and under which invented
and unscriptural Barbarism this Notion of <i>Imputed Sin to Infants</i> took
Place among Christians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Absolute Reprobation, <i>that horrible and blasphemous Doctrine, described</i>.</span>Hitherto we have considered Man’s fallen, lost, corrupted,
and degenerated Condition. Now it is fit to enquire, <i>How
and by what Means he may come to be freed out of this miserable and depraved
Condition</i>, which in these two Propositions is declared and demonstrated;
which I thought meet to place together because of their
Affinity, the one being as it were an Explanation of the other.</p>

<p>As for that Doctrine which these Propositions chiefly strike at, to
wit, <i>absolute Reprobation</i>, according to which some are not afraid to
assert, “That God, by an Eternal and Immutable Decree, hath
Predestinated to <i>Eternal Damnation</i> the far greater Part of Mankind,
not considered as made, much less as fallen, without any Respect
to their Disobedience or Sin, but only for the demonstrating of
the Glory of his Justice; and that for the bringing this about, he
hath appointed these miserable Souls necessarily to walk in their
wicked Ways, that so his Justice may lay hold on them: And that
God doth therefore not only suffer them to be liable to this Misery
in many Parts of the World, by with-holding from them the
Preaching of the Gospel and the Knowledge of Christ, but even in
those Places where the Gospel is preached, and Salvation by Christ
is offered; whom though he publickly invite them, yet he justly
condemns for Disobedience, albeit he hath with-held from them
all Grace by which they could have laid hold of the Gospel, <i>viz.</i>
Because he hath, by a secret Will unknown to all Men, ordained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
and decreed (without any Respect had to their Obedience or Sin)
that they shall not obey, and that the Offer of the Gospel shall
never prove effectual for their Salvation, but only serve to aggravate
and occasion their greater Condemnation.”</p>

<p>I say, as to this horrible and blasphemous Doctrine, our Cause is
common with many others, who have both wisely and learnedly,
according to Scripture, Reason, and Antiquity, refuted it. Seeing
then that so much is said already and so well against this Doctrine,
that little can be superadded, except what hath been said already,
I shall be short in this Respect; yet, because it lies so in Opposition
to my Way, I cannot let it altogether pass.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>This Doctrine a Novelty.</i></span>First, We may safely call this Doctrine a Novelty, seeing in the
first four hundred Years after Christ there is no Mention made of it:
For as it is contrary to the Scriptures Testimony, and to the Tenor
of the Gospel, so all the ancient Writers, Teachers, and Doctors of
the Church pass it over with a profound Silence.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Rise of it.</i></span>The first Foundations
of it were laid in the later Writings of <i>Augustine</i>, who, in his
Heat against <i>Pelagius</i>, let fall some Expressions which some have unhappily
gleaned up, to the establishing of this Error; thereby contradicting
the Truth, and sufficiently gainsaying many others, and many
more and frequent Expressions of the same <i>Augustine</i>. Afterwards
was this Doctrine fomented by <i>Dominicus</i> a Friar, and the Monks of
his Order; and at last unhappily taken up by <i>John Calvin</i> (otherwise
a Man in divers Respects to be commended) to the great staining of
his Reputation, and Defamation both of the <i>Protestant</i> and Christian
Religion; which though it received the Decrees of the Synod of <i>Dort</i>
for its Confirmation, hath since lost Ground, and begins to be exploded
by most Men of Learning and Piety in all <i>Protestant</i> Churches.
However, we should not oppugn it for the Silence of the Ancients,
Paucity of its Assertors, or for the Learnedness of its Opposers, if we
did observe it to have any real Bottom in the Writings or Sayings
of Christ and the Apostles, and that it were not <i>highly injurious to God
himself, to Jesus Christ our Mediator and Redeemer, and to the Power, Vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>tue,
Nobility, and Excellency if his blessed Gospel, and lastly unto all Mankind</i>.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Highly injurious to God, in making him the Author of Sin.</i></span>First, <i>It is highly injurious to God</i>, because it makes him the
Author of Sin, which of all Things is most contrary to his Nature.
I confess the Assertors of this Principle deny this Consequence; but
that is but a mere Illusion, seeing it so naturally follows from this
Doctrine, and is equally ridiculous, as if a Man should pertinaciously
deny that <i>one</i> and <i>two</i> make <i>three</i>. For if God has decreed that
the reprobated Ones shall perish, without all Respect to their evil
Deeds, but only of his own Pleasure, and if he hath also decreed
long before they were in Being, or in a Capacity to do Good or
Evil, that they should walk in those wicked Ways, by which, as by
a secondary Means, they are led to that End, who, I pray, is the
first Author and Cause thereof but God, who so willed and decreed?
This is as natural a Consequence as can be: And therefore, although
many of the Preachers of this Doctrine have sought out various,
strange, strained and intricate Distinctions to defend their Opinion,
and avoid this horrid Consequence; yet some, and that of the most
eminent of them, have been so plain in the Matter, as they have
put it beyond all Doubt; of which I shall instance a few among
many Passages. <a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><i>I say, That by the Ordination and Will of God </i>Adam<i>
fell. God would have Man to fall. Man is blinded by the Will and Commandment
of God. We refer the Causes of hardening us to God. The highest
or remote Cause of hardening is the Will of God. It followeth that the
hidden Counsel of God is the Cause of hardening.</i> These are <i>Calvin</i>’s Expressions.

<p>If these Sayings do not plainly and evidently import, that <i>God is the
Author of Sin</i>, we must not then seek these Men’s Opinions from their
Words, but some Way else. It seems as if they had assumed to themselves
that monstrous and twofold Will they feigned of God; one by
which they declare their Minds openly, and another more secret
and hidden, which is quite contrary to the other. Nor doth it at
all help them to say, That Man sins willingly, since that Willingness,
Proclivity, and Propensity to Evil is, according to their Judgment,
so necessarily imposed upon him, that he cannot but be willing,
because God hath willed and decreed him to be so. Which
shift is just as if I should take a Child uncapable to resist me, and
throw it down from a great Precipice; the Weight of the Child’s Body
indeed makes it go readily down, and the Violence of the Fall upon
some Rock or Stone beats out its Brains and kills it. Now then, I
pray, though the Body of the Child goes willingly down (for I suppose
it as to its Mind uncapable of any Will) and the Weight of its
Body, and not any immediate Stroke of my Hand, who perhaps am
at a great Distance, makes it die, whether is the Child or I the proper
Cause of its Death? Let any Man of Reason judge, if God’s Part
be, with them, as great, yea, more immediate, in the Sins of Men,
as by the Testimonies above brought doth appear, whether doth not
this make him not only the Author of Sin, but more unjust than the
unjustest of Men?</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>2. It makes God delight in the Death of a Sinner.</i></span>Secondly, <i>This Doctrine is injurious to God</i>, because it makes

that he might shew forth his Justice and Power in them, as these
Men affirm, and for effecting thereof hath not only with-held from
them the Means of doing Good, but also predestinated the Evil,
that they might fall into it; and that he inclines and forces them
into great Sins; certainly he must necessarily delight in their Death,

the Love of God towards all Mankind, if it was afore-decreed that
it should be of no Service to the far greater Part of Mankind. It is

the Preaching of Faith and Repentance, and the whole Tenor of the
Gospel-promises and Threatenings, as being all relative to a former Decree

a Testimony of God’s Wrath to the World, and one of the greatest Judgments,
and severest Acts of God’s Indignation towards Mankind</i>, it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
only ordained to save a very few, and for the hardening, and augmenting
the Condemnation of the far greater Number of Men, because
they believe not truly in it; the Cause of which Unbelief again,
as the Divines [so called] above assert, is the hidden Counsel of God:
Certainly the Coming of Christ was never to them a Testimony of
God’s Love, but rather of his implacable Wrath: And if the World
may be taken for the far greater Number of such as live in it, God
never loved the World, according to this Doctrine, but rather hated
it greatly, in sending his Son to be crucified in it.</p>

<span class="sidenote">6. <i>It renders Mankind in a worse Condition than the Devils&mdash;</i></span>Sixthly, <i>This Doctrine is highly injurious to Mankind</i>; for it renders
them in a far worse Condition than the Devils in Hell. For
these were sometime in a Capacity to have stood, and do suffer only
for their own Guilt; whereas many Millions of Men are for ever
tormented, according to them, for <i>Adam</i>’s Sin, which they neither
knew of, nor ever were accessary to; it renders them worse than the
Beasts of the Field, of whom the Master requires no more than they
are able to perform; and if they be killed, Death to them is the
End of Sorrow; whereas Man is for ever tormented for not doing
that which he never was able to do.
<span class="sidenote">&mdash;<i>Than the</i> Israelites <i>under</i> Pharaoh.</span>It puts him into a far worse
Condition than <i>Pharaoh</i> put the <i>Israelites</i>; for though he with-held
Straw from them, yet by much Labour and Pains they could have
gotten it: But from Men they make God to with-hold all Means of
Salvation, so that they can by no Means attain it;
<span class="sidenote">Tantalus’<i>s Condition</i>.</span>yea, they place
Mankind in that Condition which the Poets feign of <i>Tantalus</i>, who,
oppressed with Thirst, stands in Water up to the Chin, yet can by
no Means reach it with his Tongue; and being tormented with
Hunger, hath Fruits hanging at his very Lips, yet so as he can never
lay hold on them with his Teeth; and these Things are so near him,
not to nourish him, but to torment him. So do these Men: They
make the outward Creation of the Works of Providence, the Smiting
of Conscience, sufficient to convince the <i>Heathens</i> of Sin, and so to
condemn and judge them: But not at all to help them to Salvation.
They make the Preaching of the Gospel, the Offer of Salvation by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
Christ, the Use of the Sacraments, of Prayer, and good Works, sufficient
to condemn those they account <i>Reprobates</i> within the Church,
serving only to inform them, to beget a seeming Faith and vain Hope;
yet because of a secret Impotency, which they had from their Infancy,
all these are wholly ineffectual to bring them the least Step towards
Salvation; and do only contribute to render their Condemnation the
greater, and their Torments the more violent and intolerable.</div>

<p>Having thus briefly removed this false Doctrine which stood in
my Way, because they that are desirous may see it both learnedly
and piously refuted by many others, I come to the Matter of our
Proposition, which is, That <i>God out of his infinite Love, who delighteth
not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all should live and be saved, hath sent
his only begotten Son into the World, that whosoever believeth in him might be
saved</i>; which also is again affirmed in the sixth Proposition, in these
Words, <span class="sidenote">Christ <i>tasted Death for every Man</i>.</span><i>Christ then tasted Death for every Man, of all Kinds</i>.
Such is the
Evidence of this Truth, delivered almost wholly in the express Words
of Scripture, that it will not need much Probation. Also, because
our Assertion herein is common with many others, who have both
earnestly and soundly, according to the Scripture, pleaded for this
<i>universal Redemption</i>, I shall be the more brief in it, that I may come
to that which may seem more singularly and peculiarly ours.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Christ’<i>s Redemption universal, contrary to the Doctrine of</i> Absolute Reprobation.</span>This Doctrine of <i>universal Redemption</i>, or <i>Christ’s dying for all
Men</i>, is of itself so evident from the Scripture-Testimony, that there
is scarce found any other Article of the Christian Faith so frequently,
so plainly, and so positively asserted. It is that which maketh the
preaching of Christ to be truly termed the <i>Gospel</i>, or an <i>Annunciation
of glad Tidings to all</i>. Thus the Angel declared the Birth and Coming
of Christ to the Shepherds to be, <i>Luke</i> ii. 10. <i>Behold, I bring you good
Tidings of great Joy, which shall be to all People</i>: He saith not, to <i>a few</i>.
Now if this coming of Christ had not brought a Possibility of Salvation
<i>to all</i>, it should rather have been accounted bad Tidings of
great Sorrow to most People; neither should the Angel have had
Reason to have sung, <i>Peace on Earth, and good Will towards Men</i>, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
greatest Part of Mankind had been necessarily shut out from receiving
any Benefit by it. How should Christ have sent out his Servants to
<i>preach the Gospel to every Creature</i>, Mark xvi. 15. (a very comprehensive
Commission) that is, <i>to every Son and Daughter of Mankind</i>, without all
Exception? He commands them to preach <i>Salvation to all, Repentance
and Remission of Sins to all; warning every one, and exhorting every one</i>, as
<i>Paul</i> did, <i>Col.</i> i. 28. Now how could they have preached the Gospel
<i>to every Man</i>, as became the Ministers of Jesus Christ, in much
Assurance, if Salvation by that Gospel had not been possible to all?
What! if some of those had asked them, or should now ask any of
these Doctors, who deny the Universality of Christ’s Death, and yet
preach it to all promiscuously, <i>Hath Christ died for me?</i> How can they,
with Confidence, give a certain Answer to this Question? If they
give a conditional Answer, as their Principle obligeth them to do,
and say, <i>If thou repent, Christ hath died for thee</i>; doth not the same
Question still recur? <i>Hath Christ died for me, so as to make Repentance possible
to me?</i> To this they can answer nothing, unless they run in a
Circle; whereas the <i>Feet of those that bring the glad Tidings of the Gospel
of Peace </i>are said to be<i> beautiful</i>, for that they preach the <i>common Salvation</i>,
Repentance unto all; offering a Door of Mercy and Hope to
all, through <i>Jesus Christ, who gave himself a Ransom for all</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Gospel is preached to every Man.</i></span>The Gospel
invites all: And certainly, by the Gospel <i>Christ</i> intended not to deceive
and delude the greater Part of Mankind, when he invites, and
crieth, saying; <i>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and
I will give you Rest</i>. If all then ought to seek after him, and to look
for Salvation by him, he must needs have made <i>Salvation possible</i> to
<i>all</i>; for who is bound to seek after that which is impossible? Certainly
it were a mocking of Men to bid them do so. And such as
deny, that by the Death of Christ <i>Salvation</i> is made <i>possible to all Men</i>,
do most blasphemously make God mock the World, in giving his
Servants a Commission to <i>preach the Gospel of Salvation unto all</i>, while
he hath before decreed that it shall not be possible for them to receive
it. Would not this make the Lord to send forth his Servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
with a <i>Lie in their Mouth</i>, (which were blasphemous to think) commanding
them to bid <i>all</i> and <i>every one</i> believe that Christ died for
them, and had purchased Life and Salvation?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Absurdity of that Doctrine of</i> Absolute Reprobation.</span>whereas it is no such
Thing, according to the fore-mentioned Doctrine. But seeing Christ,
after he arose and perfected the Work of our Redemption, gave a
Commission to preach <i>Repentance</i>, <i>Remission of Sins</i>, and <i>Salvation</i> to all,
it is manifest that he <i>died for all</i>. For He that hath commissionated
his Servants thus to preach, is a <i>God of Truth</i>, and no Mocker of
poor Mankind; neither doth he require of any Man that which is
simply impossible for him to do: For that <i>no Man is bound to do that
which is impossible</i>, is a Principle of Truth engraven in every Man’s
Mind. And seeing he is both a righteous and merciful God, it cannot
at all stand, either with his Justice or Mercy, to bid such Men
<i>repent</i> or <i>believe</i>, to whom it is impossible.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3> Moreover, if we regard the Testimony of the Scripture in
this Matter, where there is not one Scripture, that I know of, which
affirmeth, <i>Christ not to die for all</i>, there are divers that positively and
expresly assert, <i>He did</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>To pray for </i>all<i>; for Christ died for</i> all&mdash;</span>as 1 <i>Tim.</i> ii. 1, 3, 4, 6. <i>I exhort therefore, that
first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks, be made
for all Men</i>, &amp;c. <i>For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour,
who will have all Men to be saved, and to come to the Knowledge of the
Truth; who gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due Time.</i> Except
we will have the Apostle here to assert quite another Thing than
he intended, there can be nothing more plain to confirm what we
have asserted. And this Scripture doth well answer to that Manner
of arguing which we have hitherto used: For, first, the Apostle here
recommends them to <i>pray for all Men</i>; and to obviate such an Objection,
as if he had said with our Adversaries, <i>Christ prayed not for the
World, neither willeth he us to pray for all; because he willeth not that all
should be saved, but hath ordained many to be damned, that he might shew
forth his Justice in them</i>; he obviates, I say, such an Objection, telling
them, that <i>it is good and acceptable in the Sight of God, who will have all
Men to be saved.</i>
<span class="sidenote">&mdash;<i>And will have </i>all<i> Men to be saved.</i></span>I desire to know what can be more expresly af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>firmed?
or can any two Propositions be stated in Terms more contradictory
than these two? <i>God willeth some not to be saved</i>; and <i>God willeth
all Men to be saved</i>, or God <i>will have no Man perish</i>. If we believe the
last, as the Apostle hath affirmed, the first must be destroyed; seeing
of contradictory Propositions, the one being admitted, the other is destroyed.
Whence, to conclude, he gives us a Reason of his Willingness
that all Men should be saved, in these Words, <i>Who gave himself a
Ransom for all</i>; as if he would have said, Since Christ died for all, since
he gave himself a Ransom for all, therefore he will have all Men to
be saved. This Christ himself gives as a Reason of God’s Love to
the World, in these Words: <i>John</i> iii. 16. <i>God so loved the World, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that </i>whosoever<i> believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting Life</i>; compared with 1 <i>John</i> iv. 9. This
[<i>whosoever</i>] is an indefinite Term, from which no Man is excluded.
From all which then I thus argue:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 1.</i></span>For whomsoever it is lawful to pray, to them Salvation is possible:</p>

<p>But it is lawful to pray for every individual Man in the whole
World:</p>

<p>Therefore Salvation is possible unto them.</p>

<p>I prove the <i>Major Proposition</i> thus;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 2.</i></span>No Man is bound to pray for that which is impossible to be attained:</p>

<p>But every Man is bound and commanded to pray for all Men:</p>

<p>Therefore it is not impossible to be obtained.</p>

<p>I prove also this <i>Proposition</i> further, thus;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 3.</i></span>No Man is bound to pray, but in Faith:</p>

<p>But he that prayeth for that, which he judges simply impossible
to be obtained, cannot pray in Faith:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Again,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 4.</i></span>That which God willeth is not impossible:</p>

<p>But God willeth all Men to be saved:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Therefore it is not impossible.</p>

<p>And Lastly;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg. 5.</i></span>Those for whom our Saviour gave himself a Ransom, to such
Salvation is possible:</p>

<p>But our Saviour gave himself a Ransom for all:</p>

<p>Therefore Salvation is possible.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 1.</i></span>This is very positively affirmed, <i>Heb.</i> ii. 9. in these
Words, <i>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for
the suffering of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour, that he by the Grace
of God might taste Death for every Man</i>. He that will but open his Eyes,
may see this Truth here asserted: If he <i>tasted Death for every Man</i>, then
certainly there is no Man for whom he did not taste Death; then
there is no Man who may not be made a Sharer of the Benefit of it:
For <i>he came not to condemn the World, but that the World through him might
be saved</i>, John iii. 17. <i>He came not to judge the World, but to save the
World</i>, John xii. 47.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Our Adversaries false Doctrine of a great Part of Mankind being pre-ordained for Damnation, refuted.</i></span>Whereas, according to the Doctrine of our Adversaries,
he rather came to condemn the World, and judge it; and
not that it might be saved by him, or to save it. For if he never
came to bring Salvation to the greater Part of Mankind, but that his
Coming, though it could never do them good, yet shall augment their
Condemnation, from thence it necessarily follows, that he came not
of Intention to save, but to judge and condemn the greater Part of
the World, contrary to his own express Testimony; and as the Apostle
<i>Paul</i>, in the Words above cited, doth assert affirmatively, <i>That God
willeth the Salvation of all</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 2.</i></span>so doth the Apostle <i>Peter</i> assert negatively,
<i>That he willeth not the perishing of any</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 9. <i>The Lord is not slack
concerning his Promise, as some Men count Slackness, but is long-suffering to
us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</i>
And this is correspondent to that of the Prophet <i>Ezekiel</i>,
xxxiii. 11. <i>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no Pleasure in the Death of the
Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live.</i> If it be safe to
believe God, and trust in him, we must not think that he intends
to cheat us by all these Expressions through his Servants, but that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
was in good earnest. And that this Will and Desire of his hath not
taken effect, the Blame is on our Parts, as shall be after spoken
of; which could not be, if we never were in any Capacity of Salvation,
or that Christ had never died for us, but left us under an Impossibility
of Salvation. What mean all those earnest Invitations,
all those serious Expostulations, all those regretting Contemplations,
wherewith the Holy Scriptures are full? As, <i>Why will you die, O House
of </i>Israel!<i> Why will ye not come unto me, that ye might have Life? I have
waited to be gracious unto you: I have sought to gather you: I have knocked
at the Door of your Hearts: Is not your Destruction of yourselves? I have
called all the Day long.</i> If Men who are so invited be under no Capacity
of being saved, if Salvation be impossible unto them, shall
we suppose God in this to be no other but like the Author of a
<i>Romance</i>, or Master of a <i>Comedy</i>, who amuses and raises the various
Affections and Passions of his Spectators by divers and strange Accidents;
sometimes leading them into Hope, and sometimes into Despair;
all those Actions, in effect, being but a mere Illusion, while
he hath appointed what the Conclusion of all shall be?</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 3.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, This Doctrine is abundantly confirmed by that of the
Apostle, 1 <i>John</i> ii. 1, 2. <i>And if any Man sin, we have an Advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous. And he is the Propitiation for our
Sins; and not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Adversaries comment on the Words the</i> whole World.</span>
The Way which our Adversaries take to evite this Testimony, is most
foolish and ridiculous: <i>The [World] here, </i>say they,<i> is the World of Believers</i>:
For this <i>Commentary</i> we have nothing but their own Assertion,
and so while it manifestly destroys the Text, may be justly rejected.
For, <i>First</i>, let them shew me, if they can, in all the Scripture,
where the [<i>whole World</i>] is taken for <i>Believers</i> only; I shall shew
them where it is many Times taken for the quite Contrary; as, <i>The
World knows me not</i>: <i>The World receives me not, I am not of this World</i>:
Besides all these Scriptures, <i>Psalm</i> xvii. 14. <i>Isai.</i> xiii. 11. <i>Mat.</i> xviii. 7.
<i>John</i> vii. 7. and viii. 26. and xii. 19. and xiv. 17. and xv. 18, 19. and
xvii. 14. and xviii. 20. 1 <i>Cor.</i> i. 21. and ii. 12. and vi. 2. <i>Gal.</i> vi. 14.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
<i>James</i> i. 27. 2 <i>Pet.</i> ii. 20. 1 <i>John</i> ii. 15. and iii. 1. and iv. 4, 5, and
many more. <i>Secondly</i>, The Apostle in this very Place contra-distinguished
the <i>World</i> from the <i>Saints</i> thus; <i>And not for ours only, but
for the Sins of the whole World</i>: What means the Apostle by [<i>Ours</i>]
here? Is not that the Sins of Believers? Was not he one of those
Believers? And was not this an universal Epistle, written to all the
Saints that then were? So that according to these Men’s Comment,
there should be a very unnecessary and foolish Redundancy in the
Apostle’s Words; as if he had said, <i>He is a Propitiation not only for the
Sins of all Believers, but for the Sins of all Believers</i>: Is not this to make
the Apostle’s Words void of good Sense? Let them shew us wherever
there is such a Manner of speaking in all the Scripture, where
any of the Penmen first name the <i>Believers</i> in <i>Concreto</i> with themselves,
and then contra-distinguish them from some other whole
World of Believers? That [<i>whole World</i>] if it be of Believers, must
not be the World we live in. But we need no better Interpreter
for the Apostle than himself, who uses the very same Expression and
Phrase in the same Epistle, Ch. v. 19. saying, <i>We know that we are of
God, and the whole World lieth in Wickedness</i>. There cannot be found
in all the Scripture two Places which run more parallel; seeing in
both the same Apostle, in the same Epistle to the same Persons, contra-distinguisheth
himself, and the Saints to whom he writes, from
the whole World; which, according to these Men’s Commentary,
ought to be understood of <i>Believers</i>: As if <i>John</i> had said, <i>We know
particular Believers are of God; but the whole World of Believers lieth in
Wickedness</i>. What absurd wresting of Scripture were this? And yet
it may be as well pleaded for as the other; for they differ not at all.
Seeing then that the Apostle <i>John</i> tells us plainly, That Christ not
only died for him, and for the Saints and Members of the Church
of God, to whom he wrote, but for the <i>whole World</i>, let us then hold
it for a certain and undoubted Truth, notwithstanding the Cavils of
such as oppose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>This might also be proved from many more Scripture-Testimonies,
if it were at this Season needful. All the <i>Fathers</i>, so called,
and <i>Doctors</i> of the Church, for the first four Centuries, preached this
Doctrine; according to which they boldly held forth the Gospel of
Christ, and Efficacy of his Death;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Heathens<i> invited to Salvation; none predestinated to Damnation.</i></span>inviting and intreating the
<i>Heathens</i> to come and be Partakers of the Benefits of it, shewing
them how there was a <i>Door</i> open for them <i>all</i> to be saved through
Jesus Christ; not telling them that God had predestinated any of
them to Damnation, or had made Salvation impossible to them, by
with-holding Power and Grace, necessary to believe, from them.
But of many of their Sayings, which might be alleged, I shall only
instance a few.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 4. The Testimonies of the </i>Doctors<i> and </i>Fathers<i> of the first Church, that Christ died for all.</i></span><i>Augustine</i> on the xcvth <i>Psalm</i> saith, “The Blood of Christ is of so
great Worth, that it is of no less Value than the whole World.”
<i>Prosper ad Gall.</i> c. 9. “The Redeemer of the World gave his
Blood for the World, and the World would not be Redeemed, because
the Darkness did not receive the Light. He that saith, the
Saviour was not crucified for the Redemption of the whole World,
looks not to the Virtue of the Sacrament, but to the Part of Infidels;
since the Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ is the Price of the
whole World; from which Redemption they are Strangers, who
either delighting in their Captivity would not be Redeemed, or after
they were Redeemed returned to the same Servitude.”</p>

<p>The same <i>Prosper</i>, in his Answer to <i>Vincentius</i>’s first Objection:
“Seeing therefore because of one common Nature and Cause in
Truth, undertaken by our Lord, all are rightly said to be Redeemed,
and nevertheless all are not brought out of Captivity;
the Property of Redemption without doubt belongeth to those
from whom the Prince of this World is shut out, and now are not
Vessels of the Devil, but Members of Christ; whole Death was
so bestowed upon Mankind, that it belonged to the Redemption
of such who were not to be regenerated. But so, that that which
was done by the Example of one for all, might, by a singular My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>stery,
be celebrated in every one. For the Cup of Immortality,
which is made up of our Infirmity and the Divine Power, hath indeed
that in it which may Profit all; but if it be not drank, it
doth not heal.”</p>

<p>The Author <i>de Vocat. Gentium</i>, Lib. 11. Cap. 6. “There is no Cause
to doubt but that our Lord Jesus Christ died for Sinners and wicked
Men. And if there can be any found, who may be said not to
be of this Number, Christ hath not died for all; he made himself
a Redeemer for the whole World.”</p>

<p><i>Chrysostom</i> on <i>John</i> i. “If he enlightens every Man coming into
the World, how comes it that so many Men remain without
Light? For all do not so much as acknowledge Christ. How then
doth he enlighten every Man? He illuminates indeed so far as in
him is; but if any of their own accord, closing the Eyes of their
Mind, will not direct their Eyes unto the Beams of this Light,<span class="sidenote"><i>The Cause they remain in Darkness.</i></span> the
Cause that they remain in Darkness is not from the Nature of the
Light,
but through their own Malignity, who willingly have rendered
themselves unworthy of so great a Gift. But why believed
they not? Because they would not: Christ did his Part.”</p>

<p>The <i>Arelatensian</i> Synod, held about the Year 490, “Pronounced
him accursed, who should say that Christ hath not died for all, or
that he would not have all Men to be saved.”</p>

<p><i>Ambr.</i> on <i>Psalm</i> cxviii. <i>Serm. 8.</i> “The mystical Sun of Righteousness
is arisen to all; he came to all; he suffered for all; and rose
again for all: And therefore he suffered, that he might take away
the Sin of the World. But if any one believe not in Christ, he
robs himself of this general Benefit,<span class="sidenote"><i>The Sun-Beams shut out, heat not.</i></span> even as if one by closing the
Windows should hold out the Sun-Beams.
The Sun is not therefore
not arisen to all, because such an one hath so robbed himself
of its Heat: But the Sun keeps its Prerogative; it is such an
one’s Imprudence that he shuts himself out from the common Benefit
of the Light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>The same Man, in his 11th Book of <i>Cain</i> and <i>Abel</i>, Cap. 13. saith,
“Therefore he brought unto all the Means of Health, that whosoever
should perish, may ascribe to himself the Causes of his Death,
who would not be cured when he had the Remedy by which he
might have escaped.”</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3> Seeing then that this Doctrine of the Universality of Christ’s
Death is so certain and agreeable to the Scripture-Testimony, and to
the Sense of the purest Antiquity, it may be wondered how so many,
some whereof have been esteemed not only Learned, but also Pious,
have been capable to fall into so gross and strange an Error. But
the Cause of this doth evidently appear, in that the Way and Method
by which the Virtue and Efficacy of his Death is communicated
to all Men, hath not been rightly understood, or indeed hath
been erroneously taught.
<span class="sidenote">Pelagian <i>Errors.</i></span>The <i>Pelagians</i>, ascribing all to Man’s
Will and Nature, denied Man to have any Seed of Sin conveyed to
him from <i>Adam</i>. And the <i>Semi-Pelagians</i>, making Grace as a Gift
following upon Man’s Merit, or right improving of his Nature, according
to the known Principle, <i>Facienti quod in se est, Deus non denegat
gratiam</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Extremes fallen into by some, making God the Author of Sin.</i></span>This gave <i>Augustine</i>, <i>Prosper</i>, and some others Occasion, labouring, in
Opposition to these Opinions, to magnify the Grace of God, and
paint out the Corruptions of Man’s Nature (as the Proverb is of
those that seek to make straight a crooked Stick) to incline to the
other Extreme. So also the Reformers, <i>Luther</i> and others, finding
among other Errors the strange Expressions used by some of the Popish
Scholasticks concerning Free-Will, and how much the Tendency
of their Principles is to exalt Man’s Nature and lessen God’s Grace,
having all those Sayings of <i>Augustine</i> and others for a Pattern, through
the like Mistake run upon the same Extreme: Though afterwards the
<i>Lutherans</i>, seeing how far <i>Calvin</i> and his Followers drove this Matter,
(who, as a Man of subtle and profound judgment, foreseeing where
it would land, resolved above-board to assert that God had decreed
the Means as well as the End, and therefore had ordained Men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
sin, and excites them thereto, which he labours earnestly to defend)
and that there was no avoiding the making of God the Author of
Sin, thereby received Occasion to discern the Falsity of this Doctrine,
and disclaimed it, as appears by the latter Writings of <i>Melancthon</i>,
and the <i>Mompelgartensian</i> Conference, <a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>where <i>Lucas Osiander</i>, one of the
Collocutors, terms it <i>Impious</i>; calls it a making <i>God the Author of Sin</i>,
and an <i>horrid and horrible Blasphemy</i>. Yet because none of those who
have asserted this universal Redemption since the Reformation have
given a clear, distinct, and satisfactory Testimony how it is communicated
to all, and so have fallen short of fully declaring the Perfection
of the Gospel Dispensation, others have been thereby the more
strengthened in their Errors; which I shall illustrate by one singular
Example.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> <i>Epit. Hist. Eccl. </i>Lucæ Osiand. Cent. 16.<i> l. 4. Cap. 32.</i></p></div>

<p>The <i>Arminians</i>, and other Assertors of universal Grace, use this as
a chief Argument.</p>

<p><i>That which every Man is bound to believe, is true</i>:</p>

<p><i>But every Man is bound to believe that Christ died for him</i>:</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Remonstrants <i>Opinion strengthens the precise Decree of Reprobation</i>.</span>Of this Argument the other Party deny the Assumption, saying;
That <i>they who never heard of Christ, are not obliged to believe in him</i>; <i>and
seeing the Remonstrants </i>(as they are commonly called)<i> do generally themselves
acknowledge, that without the outward Knowledge of Christ there is no
Salvation</i>, that gives the other Party yet a stronger Argument for their
precise Decree of Reprobation. <i>For, </i>say they,<i> seeing we all see really,
and in effect, that God hath with-held from many Generations, and yet from
Nations, that Knowledge which is absolutely needful to Salvation, and so
hath rendered it simply impossible unto them; Why may he not as well with-hold
the Grace necessary to make a saving Application of that Knowledge, where it
is preached? For there is no Ground to say, That this were Injustice in God, or
Partiality, more than his leaving those others in utter Ignorance; the one being
but a with-holding Grace to apprehend the Object of Faith, the other a withdrawing
the Object itself.</i> For answer to this, they are forced to draw a
Conclusion from their former <i>Hypothesis</i> of Christ’s dying for all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
God’s Mercy and Justice, saying, That <i>if these </i>Heathens,<i> who live in
those remote Places, where the outward Knowledge of Christ is not, did improve
that common Knowledge they have, to whom the outward Creation is for an Object
of Faith, by which they may gather that there is a God, then the Lord
would by some Providence, either send an Angel to tell them of Christ, or convey
the Scriptures to them, or bring them some Way an Opportunity to meet
with such as might inform them.</i> Which, as it gives always too much
to the Power and Strength of Man’s Will and Nature, and favours
a little of <i>Socinianism</i> and <i>Pelagianism</i>, or at least of <i>Semi-Pelagianism</i>, so,
since it is only built upon probable Conjectures, neither hath it Evidence
enough to convince any strongly tainted with the other Doctrine;
nor yet doth it make the Equity and wonderful Harmony of
God’s Mercy and Justice towards <i>ALL</i> so manifest to the Understanding.
So that I have often observed, that these Assertors of Universal
Grace did far more pithily and strongly overturn the false Doctrine
of their Adversaries, than they did establish and confirm the
Truth and Certainty of their own.
<span class="sidenote"><i>None, by an irrevocable Decree, excluded from Salvation.</i></span>And though they have Proof
sufficient from the Holy Scriptures to confirm the Universality of
Christ’s Death, and that none are precisely, by any irrevocable Decree,
excluded from Salvation, yet I find when they are pressed in
the Respects above-mentioned, to shew how God hath so far equally
extended the Capacity to partake of the Benefit of Christ’s Death
unto all, as to communicate unto them a sufficient Way of so doing,
they are somewhat in a Strait, and are put more to give us their Conjectures
from the Certainty of the former pre-supposed Truth, to wit,
that because Christ hath certainly died for all, and God hath not
rendered Salvation impossible to any, therefore there must be some
Way or other by which they may be saved; which must be by improving
some common Grace, or by gathering from the Works of
Creation and Providence, than by really demonstrating, by convincing
and spiritual Arguments, what that Way is.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3> It falls out then, that as Darkness, and the great Apostasy,
came not upon the Christian World all at once, but by several Degrees,
one Thing making way for another; until that thick and gross
Veil came to be overspread, wherewith the Nations were so blindly
covered, from the <i>seventh</i> and <i>eighth</i>, until the <i>sixteenth Century</i>; even
as the Darkness of the Night comes not upon the outward Creation
at once, but by Degrees, according as the Sun declines in each Horizon;
so neither did that full and clear Light and Knowledge of the
glorious Dispensation of the Gospel of Christ appear all at once; the
Work of the first Witnesses being more to testify against and discover
the Abuses of the Apostasy, than to establish the Truth in Purity.
He that comes to build a new City, must first remove the old Rubbish,
before he can see to lay a new Foundation; and he that comes
to an House greatly polluted and full of Dirt, will first sweep away
and remove the Filth, before he put up his own good and new
Furniture. The dawning of the Day dispels the Darkness, and
makes us see the Things that are most conspicuous: But the distinct
discovering and discerning of Things, so as to make a certain
and perfect Observation, is reserved for the arising of the Sun,
and its shining in full Brightness. And we can, from a certain
Experience, boldly affirm, that the not waiting for this, but building
among, yea, and with, the <i>Old Popish Rubbish</i>, and setting up before
a full Purgation, hath been to most Protestants the Foundation
of many a Mistake, and an Occasion of unspeakable Hurt.<span class="sidenote"><i>The more full Discovery of the Gospel reserved to this our Age.</i></span> Therefore
the Lord God, who as he seeth meet doth communicate and
make known to Man the more full, evident, and perfect Knowledge
of his everlasting Truth, hath been pleased to reserve the more full
Discovery of this Glorious and Evangelical Dispensation to this our
Age; albeit divers Testimonies have thereunto been borne by some
noted Men in several Ages, as shall hereafter appear. And for the
greater Augmentation of the Glory of his Grace, that no Man might
have whereof to boast, he hath raised up a few <i>despicable and illiterate
Men</i>, and for the most Part <i>Mechanicks</i>, to be the Dispensers of it; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
which Gospel all the Scruples, Doubts, Hesitations and Objections
above-mentioned are easily and evidently answered, and the Justice
as well as Mercy of God, according to their divine and heavenly
Harmony, are exhibited, established, and confirmed. According to
which certain Light and Gospel, as the Knowledge thereof has been
manifested to us by the Revelation of Jesus Christ <i>in us</i>, fortified by
our own sensible Experience, and sealed by the Testimony of the Spirit
in our Hearts, we can confidently affirm, and clearly evince, according
to the Testimony of the Holy Scriptures, the following
Points:</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Prop. I.</span>First, <i>That God</i>, who out of his infinite Love sent his Son,
the Lord Jesus Christ, into the World,
<span class="sidenote"><i>A day of Visitation to all.</i></span>who tasted Death for every
Man, <i>hath given to every Man</i>, whether <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, <i>Turk</i> or <i>Scythian</i>,
<i>Indian</i> or <i>Barbarian</i>, of whatsoever Nation, Country, or Place, <i>a certain
Day or Time of Visitation; during which Day or Time it is possible for
them to be saved, and to partake of the Fruit of Christ’s Death</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. II.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>A Measure of Light in all.</i></span>
Secondly, <i>That for this End God hath communicated and given unto every
Man a Measure of the Light of his own Son, a Measure of Grace, or a Measure
of the Spirit</i>, which the Scripture expresses by several Names, as
sometimes of the <i>Seed of the Kingdom</i>, Mat. xiii. 18, 19. <i>the Light that
makes all Things manifest</i>, Ephes. v. 13. <i>the Word of God</i>, Rom. x. 17. or
<i>Manifestation of the Spirit given to profit withal</i>, 1 Cor. xii. 7. <i>A Talent</i>,
Mat. xxv. 15. <i>A little Leaven</i>, Mat. xiii. 33. the <i>Gospel preached in every
Creature</i>, Col. i. 23.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. III.</span>Thirdly, <i>That God, in and by this Light and Seed, invites, calls, exhorts,
and strives with every Man, in order to save him</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>God’s Salvation wrought by the Light in all.</i></span>which, as it is received
and not resisted, works the Salvation of <i>all</i>, even of those who are ignorant
of the Death and Sufferings of Christ, and of <i>Adam</i>’s Fall, both
by bringing them to a Sense of their own <i>Misery</i>, and to be Sharers
in the Sufferings of Christ inwardly, and by making them Partakers
of his Resurrection, in becoming Holy, Pure, and Righteous, and recovered
out of their Sins. By which also are saved they that have
the Knowledge of Christ outwardly, in that it opens their Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>standing
rightly to use and apply the Things delivered in the Scriptures,
and to receive the saving Use of them: But <i>that this may be resisted
and rejected in both, in which then God is said to be resisted and pressed
down, and Christ to be again crucified, and put to open Shame in and among
Men</i>. And to those who thus resist and refuse him, he becomes their
Condemnation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 1.</i></span>First then, According to this Doctrine <i>the Mercy of God is excellently
well exhibited</i>, in that none are necessarily shut out from Salvation;
and his Justice is demonstrated, in that he condemns none but such
to whom he really made offer of Salvation, affording them the Means
sufficient thereunto.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 2.</i></span>Secondly, This Doctrine, if well weighed, will be found to be the
<i>Foundation of Christianity, Salvation, and Assurance.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 3.</i></span>Thirdly, It agrees and answers <i>with the whole Tenor of the Gospel
Promises and Threats, and with the Nature of the Ministry of Christ</i>; according
to which, the Gospel, Salvation, and Repentance are commanded
to be preached to every Creature, without Respect of Nations,
Kindred, Families or Tongues.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 4.</i></span>Fourthly, <i>It magnifies and commends the Merits and Death of Christ</i>, in
that it not only accounts them sufficient to save all, but declares
them to be brought so nigh unto all, as thereby to be put into the
nearest Capacity of Salvation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 5.</i></span>Fifthly, <i>It exalts above all the Grace of God</i>, to which it attributeth all
Good, even the least and smallest Actions that are so; ascribing thereunto
not only the first Beginnings and Motions of Good, but also
the whole Conversion and Salvation of the Soul.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 6.</i></span>Sixthly, <i>It contradicts, overturns, and enervates the false Doctrine of the</i>
Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Socinians, <i>and others</i>, who exalt the Light
of Nature, the Liberty of Man’s Will, in that it wholly excludes the
natural Man from having any Place or Portion in his own Salvation,
by any acting, moving, or working of his own, until he be first
quickened, raised up, and actuated by God’s Spirit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 7.</i></span>Seventhly, <i>As it makes the whole Salvation of Man solely and alone to depend
upon God, so it makes his Condemnation wholly and in every Respect to be
of himself</i>, in that he refused and resisted somewhat that from God
wrestled and strove in his Heart, and forces him to acknowledge
God’s just judgment in rejecting and forsaking of him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 8.</i></span>Eighthly, <i>It takes away all Ground of Despair</i>, in that it gives every
one Cause of Hope and certain Assurance that they may be saved;
<i>neither doth feed any in Security</i>, in that none are certain how soon their
Day may expire: And therefore it is a constant Incitement and Provocation,
and lively Encouragement to every Man, to forsake Evil,
and close with that which is Good.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 9.</i></span>Ninthly, <i>It wonderfully commends as well the Certainty of the Christian
Religion among </i>Infidels<i>, as it manifests its own Verity to all</i>, in that it is
confirmed and established by the Experience of all Men; seeing
there was never yet a Man found in any Place of the Earth, however
barbarous and wild, but hath acknowledged that at some Time
or other, less or more, he hath found <i>somewhat</i> in his Heart reproving
him for some Things evil which he hath done, threatening a certain
Horror if he continued in them, as also promising and communicating
a certain Peace and Sweetness, as he has given Way to it,
and not resisted it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 10.</i></span>Tenthly, <i>It wonderfully sheweth the excellent Wisdom of God</i>, by which
he hath made the Means of Salvation so universal and comprehensive,
that it is not needful to recur to those miraculous and strange
Ways; seeing, according to this most true Doctrine, the Gospel
reacheth all, of whatsoever Condition, Age, or Nation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 11.</i></span>Eleventhly, <i>It is really and effectively, </i>though not in so many Words,
yet by Deeds,<i> established and confirmed by all the Preachers, Promulgators,
and Doctors of the </i>Christian Religion<i> that ever were, or now are, even by
those that otherways in their Judgment oppose this Doctrine</i>, in that they all,
whatever they have been or are, or whatsoever People, Place, or
Country they come to, do preach to the People, and to every Individual
among them, that they may be saved; intreating and desiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
them to believe in Christ, who hath died for them. So that
what they deny in the general, they acknowledge of every Particular;
there being no Man to whom they do not preach in order
to Salvation, telling him <i>Jesus Christ calls and wills him to believe and be
saved</i>; and that if he refuse, he shall therefore be condemned, and
that his Condemnation is of himself. Such is the Evidence and Virtue
of Truth, that it constrains its Adversaries, even against their
Wills, to plead for it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Conseq. 12.</i></span>Lastly, According to this Doctrine the former Argument used by
the <i>Arminians</i>, and evited by the <i>Calvinists</i>, concerning every Man’s
being bound to believe that <i>Christ died for him</i>, is, by altering the Assumption,
<i>rendered invincible</i>; thus,</p>

<p><i>That which every Man is bound to believe, is true</i>:</p>

<p><i>But every man is bound to believe that God is merciful unto him</i>:</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This Assumption no Man can deny, seeing <i>his Mercies</i> are said to
be <i>over all his Works</i>. And herein the Scripture every Way declares
the <i>Mercy of God</i> to be, in that he invites and calls Sinners to Repentance,
and hath opened a Way of Salvation for them: So that
though those Men be not bound to believe the <i>History of Christ’s Death
and Passion</i> who never came to know of it, yet they are bound to believe
that God will be merciful to them, if they follow his Ways,
and that he is merciful unto them, in that he reproves them for Evil,
and encourages them to Good.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Our Adversaries unmerciful Assertion of God.</i></span>Neither ought any Man to believe
that God is unmerciful to him, or that he hath from the Beginning,
ordained him to come into the World that he might be left to his
own evil Inclinations, and so do wickedly as a Means appointed by
God to bring him to eternal Damnation; which, were it true, as
our Adversaries affirm it to be of many Thousands, I see no Reason
why a Man might not believe; for certainly a Man may believe
the Truth.</p>

<p>As it manifestly appears from the Thing itself, that these good and
excellent Consequences follow from the Belief of this Doctrine, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
from the Proof of them it will yet more evidently appear; to which
before I come, it is requisite to speak somewhat concerning the State
<span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: of Controversy">of the Controversy</span>, which will bring great Light to the Matter: For
from the not right understanding of a Matter under Debate, sometimes
both Arguments on the one Hand, and Objections on the other,
are brought, which do no Way hit the Case; and hereby also our
Sense and Judgment therein will be more fully understood and
opened.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 1.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The stating of the Question.</i></span>
First then, by this <i>Day and Time of Visitation</i>, which we say
God gives unto all, during which they may be saved, <i>we do not understand
the whole Time of every Man’s Life</i>; though to some it may be
extended even to the very Hour of Death, as we see in the Example of
the Thief converted upon the Cross: But <i>such a Season at least as sufficiently
exonerateth God of every Man’s Condemnation</i>, which to some may
be sooner, and to others later, according as the Lord in his Wisdom
sees meet.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That many may out-live the Day of God’s Visitation.</i></span>So that many Men may out-live this Day, after which
there may be no Possibility of Salvation to them, and God justly suffers
them to be hardened, as a just Punishment of their Unbelief, and
even raises them up as Instruments of Wrath, and makes them a
Scourge one against another. Whence to Men in this Condition
may be fitly applied those Scriptures which are abused to prove <i>that
God incites Men necessarily to sin</i>: This is notably expressed by the
Apostle, <i>Rom.</i> i. from Ver. 17. to the End, but especially Ver. 28. <i>And
even as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, God gave them up
to a Reprobate Mind, to do those Things which are not convenient.</i> That
many may out-live this Day of God’s gracious Visitation unto them, is
shewn by the Example of <i>Esau</i>, <i>Heb.</i> xii. 16, 17. who <i>sold his Birthright</i>
So he had it once, and was capable to have kept it; but afterwards
when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected.
This appears also by Christ’s weeping over <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Luke</i> xix. 42.
saying, <i>If thou hadst known in this thy Day the Things that belong unto thy
Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes</i>. Which plainly imports a
Time when they might have known them, which now was removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
from them, though they were yet alive; but of this more shall be
said hereafter.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 2.</span>Secondly, <i>By this Seed, Grace, and Word of God, and Light
wherewith, </i>we say,<i> every one is enlightened</i>, and hath a Measure of it,
which strives with him in order to save him, and which may, by the
Stubbornness and Wickedness of Man’s Will, be quenched, bruised,
wounded, pressed down, slain and crucified, <i>we understand not the proper
Essence and Nature of God precisely taken, which is not divisible into Parts
and Measures, </i>as being a<i> most pure, simple Being, void of all Composition or
Division</i>, and therefore can neither be resisted, hurt, wounded, crucified,
or slain by all the Efforts and Strength of Men;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light what it is, and its Properties described.</i></span><i>but we understand
a spiritual, heavenly, and invisible Principle, in which God, as Father,
Son, and Spirit, dwells</i>; a Measure of which divine and glorious Life
is <i>in all Men, </i>as a<i> Seed</i>, <a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>which of its own Nature draws, invites, and
inclines to God; and this some call <i>Vehiculum Dei</i>, or the <i>spiritual
Body of Christ, the Flesh and Blood of Christ, which came down from Heaven</i>,
of which all the Saints do feed, and are thereby nourished unto eternal
Life. And as every unrighteous Action is witnessed against and
reproved by this <i>Light</i> and <i>Seed</i>, so by such Actions it is hurt, wounded,
and slain, and flees from them even as the Flesh of Man flees
from that which is of a contrary Nature to it. Now because it is
never separated from God nor Christ, <a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>but wherever it is, God and
Christ are as wrapped up therein, therefore and in that Respect as it
is resisted, God is said to be resisted; and where it is borne down,
God is said to be pressed <i>as a Cart under Sheaves</i>, and Christ is said to
be slain and crucified. And on the contrary, as this Seed is received
in the Heart, and suffered to bring forth its natural and proper
Effect, Christ comes to be formed and raised, of which the Scripture
makes so much Mention, calling it <i>the new Man</i>, <i>Christ within,
the Hope of Glory</i>. This is that <i>Christ within</i>, which we are heard so
much to speak and declare of, every where preaching him up, and
exhorting People to believe in the <i>Light</i>, and obey it, that they may
come to know <i>Christ in them</i>, to deliver them from all Sin.</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> <i>Cant. 3. 9.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> 1 Tim. vi. 16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span></p></div>

<p>But by this, as we do not at all intend to <i>equal ourselves</i> to that Holy
Man the <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>, who was born of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, in whom
all the Fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily,
<span class="sidenote"><i>That the Fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily</i>, &amp;c.</span>so neither do we <i>destroy
the Reality of his present Existence</i>, as some have falsely calumniated us.
For though we affirm that Christ dwells in us, yet not immediately,
but mediately as he is in that <i>Seed</i> which is <i>in us</i>; whereas he, to wit,
the <i>Eternal Word</i>, which was with God, and was God, dwelt immediately
in that Holy Man. He then is as the Head, and we as the
Members; he the Vine, and we the Branches. Now as the Soul of
Man dwells otherwise and in a far more immediate Manner in the
Head and in the Heart than in the Hands or Legs, and as the Sap,
Virtue, and Life of the Vine lodgeth far otherwise in the Stock and
Root than in the Branches, so God dwelleth otherwise in the Man
<i>Jesus</i> than in us. We also freely reject the Heresy of <i>Apollinarius</i>, who
denied him to have any Soul, but said the Body was only actuated
by the Godhead. As also the Error of <i>Eutyches</i>, who made the Manhood
to be wholly swallowed up of the Godhead. Wherefore, as we
believe he was a true and real Man, so we also believe that he continues
so to be glorified in the Heavens in Soul and Body, by whom
God shall judge the World, in the great and general Day of Judgment.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 3.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>That the Light is a Spiritual Substance, which may be felt in the Soul and apprehended.</i></span>
Thirdly, <i>We understand not this Seed, Light, or Grace to be
an Accident, as most Men ignorantly do, but a real spiritual Substance</i>, which
the Soul of Man is capable to feel and apprehend, from which that
real, spiritual, inward Birth in Believers arises, called <i>the New Creature</i>,
the <i>New Man in the Heart</i>. This seems strange to Carnal-minded
Men, because they are not acquainted with it; but we know it,
and are sensible of it, by a true and certain Experience. Though it
be hard for Man in his natural Wisdom to comprehend it until he
come to feel it in himself, and if he should, holding it in the mere
Notion it would avail him little, yet we are able to make it appear
to be true, and that our Faith concerning it is not without a solid
Ground: For it is in and by this inward and substantial Seed in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
Hearts as it comes to receive Nourishment, and to have a Birth or Geniture
<i>in</i> us, that we come to have those spiritual Senses raised by
which we are made capable of <i>tasting</i>, <i>smelling</i>, <i>seeing</i>, and <i>handling</i> the
Things of God: For a Man cannot reach unto those Things by his
natural Spirit and Senses, as is above declared.</div>

<p>Next, We know it to be a <i>Substance</i>, because it subsists <i>in</i> the Hearts
of wicked Men, even while they are in their Wickedness, as shall be
hereafter proved more at large. Now no <i>Accident</i> can be in a <i>Subject</i>
without it give the Subject its own Denomination; as where
<i>Whiteness</i> is in a Subject, there the Subject is called <i>White</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Degrees of its Operation in the Soul of Man.</i></span>So we
distinguish betwixt <i>Holiness</i>, as it is an <i>Accident</i>, which denominates
Man so, as the Seed receives a Place <i>in him</i>, and betwixt the <i>holy substantial
Seed</i>, which many Times lies <i>in Man’s Heart</i> as a naked Grain
in the stony Ground. So also as we may distinguish betwixt <i>Health</i>
and <i>Medicine</i>; <i>Health</i> cannot be in a Body without the Body be called
<i>Healthful</i>, because <i>Health</i> is an Accident; but <i>Medicine</i> may be in a
Body that is most unhealthful, for that it is a Substance. And as
when a <i>Medicine</i> begins to work, the Body may in some Respect be
called <i>Healthful</i>, and in some Respect <i>Unhealthful</i>, so we acknowledge
as this <i>divine Medicine</i> receives Place in <i>Man’s Heart</i>, it may denominate
him in some Part Holy and Good, though there remain yet a
corrupted unmortified Part, or some Part of the evil Humours unpurged
out; for where two contrary Accidents are in one Subject,
as <i>Health</i> and <i>Sickness</i> in a Body, the Subject receives its Denomination
from the Accident which prevails most. So many Men are
called Saints, good and holy Men, and that truly, when this holy
Seed hath wrought <i>in them</i> in a good Measure, and hath somewhat
leavened them into its Nature, though they may be yet liable to
many Infirmities and Weaknesses, yea, and to some Iniquities; for as
the Seed of Sin and Ground of Corruption, yea, and the Capacity of
yielding thereunto, and sometimes actually falling, doth not denominate
a good and holy Man <i>impious</i>; so neither doth the Seed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
Righteousness in evil Men, and the Possibility of their becoming one
with it, denominate them <i>good</i> or <i>holy</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 4.</span>Fourthly, <i>We do not hereby intend any ways to lessen or derogate
from the Atonement and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ</i>; but on the contrary
do magnify and exalt it. For as we believe all those Things to have
been certainly transacted which are recorded in the Holy Scriptures
concerning the <i>Birth</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Miracles</i>, <i>Sufferings</i>, <i>Resurrection and Ascension
of Christ</i>; so we do also believe that it is the Duty of every one to believe
it to whom it pleases God to reveal the same, and to bring to
them the Knowledge of it; yea, we believe it were <i>damnable Unbelief</i>
not to believe it, when so declared; but to resist that holy Seed,
which as minded would lead and incline every one to believe it as it
is offered unto them, though it revealeth not in every one the outward
and explicit Knowledge of it, nevertheless it always assenteth
to it, <i>ubi declaratur</i>, where it is declared. Nevertheless as we firmly
believe it was necessary that Christ should come, that by his Death
and Sufferings he might offer up himself a Sacrifice to God for our
Sins, who his own self <i>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree</i>; so we
believe that the Remission of Sins which any partake of, is only in
and by Virtue of that most satisfactory Sacrifice, and no otherwise.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That Remission of Sins is only and alone by Christ.</i></span>For it is <i>by the Obedience of that One that the Free-gift is come upon all to
Justification</i>. For we affirm, that as all Men partake of the Fruit of
<i>Adam</i>’s Fall, in that by Reason of that evil Seed, which through him
is communicated unto them, they are prone and inclined unto Evil,
though Thousands of Thousands be ignorant of <i>Adam</i>’s Fall, neither
ever knew of the Eating of the Forbidden Fruit; so also many may
come to feel the Influence of this Holy and Divine <i>Seed</i> and <i>Light</i>,
and be turned from Evil to Good by it, though they knew nothing
of Christ’s coming in the Flesh, through whose Obedience and Sufferings
it is purchased unto them. And as we affirm it is absolutely
needful that those do believe the History of Christ’s outward Appearance,
whom it pleased God to bring to the Knowledge of it; so we
do freely confess, that even that outward Knowledge is very comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>able
to such as are subject to and led by the inward <i>Seed</i> and <i>Light</i>.
For not only doth the Sense of Christ’s Love and Sufferings tend to
humble them, but they are thereby also strengthened in their Faith,
and encouraged to follow that excellent Pattern which he hath left
us, <i>who suffered for us</i>, as saith the Apostle <i>Peter</i>, 1 <i>Pet.</i> ii. 21: <i>Leaving
us an Example that we should follow his Steps</i>: And many Times we are
greatly edified and refreshed with the gracious Sayings which proceed
out of his Mouth.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The History is profitable with the Mystery.</i></span>The <i>History</i> then is profitable and comfortable
with the <i>Mystery</i>, and never without it; but the <i>Mystery</i> is and
may be profitable without the explicit and outward Knowledge of
the History.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Quest. 5. <i>How Christ is in all Men.</i></span>But <i>Fifthly</i>, This brings <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: to us">us to</span> another Question, to wit, <i>Whether
Christ be in all Men or no?</i> Which sometimes hath been asked us, and
Arguments brought against it; because indeed it is to be found in
some of our Writings that <i>Christ is in all Men</i>; and we often are heard,
in our publick <i>Meetings</i> and <i>Declarations</i>, to desire every Man to know
and be acquainted with <i>Christ in them</i>, telling them that <i>Christ is in
them</i>; it is fit therefore, for removing of all Mistakes, to say something
in this Place concerning this Matter. We have said before,
how that <i>a divine, spiritual, and supernatural Light is in all Men</i>; how
that <i>that divine supernatural Light or Seed is</i> Vehiculum Dei; how that
<i>God and Christ dwelleth in it, and is never separated from it</i>; also how that,
<i>as it is received and closed with in the Heart, Christ comes to be formed and
brought forth</i>: But we are far from ever having said, <i>That Christ is thus
formed in all Men, </i>or<i> in the Wicked</i>: For that is a great Attainment,
which the Apostle travailed that it might be brought forth in the <i>Galatians</i>.
Neither is <i>Christ in all Men</i> by Way of <i>Union</i>, or indeed, to speak
strictly, by Way of <i>Inhabitation</i>; because this <i>Inhabitation</i>, as it is generally
taken, imports <i>Union</i>, or <i>the Manner of Christ’s being in the Saints</i>:
As it is written, <i>I will dwell in them, and walk in them</i>, 2 <i>Cor.</i> vi. 16.
But in regard, <i>Christ is in all Men</i> as in a <i>Seed</i>, yea, and that he never
is nor can be separate from that <i>holy pure Seed</i> and <i>Light</i> which is <i>in
all Men</i>; therefore may it be said in a larger Sense, that he is <i>in all</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
even as we observed before. The Scripture saith, <i>Amos</i> ii. 13. God
<i>is pressed down as a Cart under Sheaves</i>, and <i>Christ crucified in the Ungodly</i>;
though to speak properly and strictly, neither can <i>God be pressed down</i>,
nor <i>Christ</i>, as <i>God</i>, be <i>crucified</i>. In this Respect then, as he is <i>in the
Seed</i> which is in <i>all Men</i>, we have said <i>Christ is in all Men</i>, and have
preached and directed all Men to <i>Christ in them</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ crucified in Man by Iniquities.</i></span>who lies crucified in
them by their Sins and Iniquities, that they may <i>look upon him whom
they have pierced</i>, and repent: Whereby he that now lies as it were
slain and buried <i>in them</i>, may come to be raised, and have Dominion
in their Hearts over all. And thus also the Apostle <i>Paul</i> preached to
the <i>Corinthians</i> and <i>Galatians</i>, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. 2. <i>Christ crucified in them</i>, [Greek: en hymin: εν ὑμιν],
as the <i>Greek</i> hath it. This <i>Jesus Christ</i> was that which the Apostle desired
to know <i>in them</i>, and make known <i>unto them</i>, that they might
come to be sensible how they had thus been <i>crucifying Christ</i>, that so
they might repent and be saved. And forasmuch as Christ is called
that <i>Light that enlightens every Man, the Light of the World</i>, therefore the
<i>Light</i> is taken for <i>Christ</i>, who truly is the Fountain of <i>Light</i>, and hath
his Habitation in it for ever. Thus the <i>Light of Christ</i> is sometimes
called <i>Christ</i>, i. e. that in which Christ is, and from which he is never
separated.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVI.</h3> <i>Sixthly</i>, It will manifestly appear by what is above said,
that <i>we understand not this Divine Principle to be any Part of Man’s Nature,
nor yet to be any Reliques of any Good which </i>Adam<i> lost by his Fall</i>, in that
we make it a distinct separate Thing from Man’s Soul, and all the
Faculties of it: Yet such is the <i>Malice</i> of our Adversaries, that they
cease not sometimes to calumniate us, as if we preached up a natural
Light, or the Light of Man’s natural Conscience. Next there <span class="correction" title="In the original book: are that">are those that</span>
lean to the Doctrine of <i>Socinus</i> and <i>Pelagius</i>, who persuade themselves
through Mistake, and out of no ill Design to injure us, as if
this which we preach up were some natural Power and Faculty
of the Soul, and that we only differ in the wording of it, and not
in the Thing itself; whereas there can be no greater Difference than
is betwixt us in that Matter: For we certainly know that this <i>Light</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
of which we speak is not only distinct, but of a different Nature from
the Soul of Man, and its Faculties.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Faculties of Man’s Reason.</i></span>Indeed that Man, as he is a
rational Creature, hath Reason as a natural Faculty of his Soul, by
which he can discern Things that are Rational, we deny not; for
this is a Property natural and essential to him, by which he can
know and learn many Arts and Sciences, beyond what any other
Animal can do by the mere animal Principle. Neither do we deny
but by this rational Principle Man may apprehend in his Brain, and
in the Notion, a Knowledge of God and spiritual Things; yet that
not being the right Organ, as in the second Proposition hath more
at length been signified, it cannot profit him towards Salvation, but
rather hindereth; and indeed the great Cause of the Apostasy hath
been, that Man hath sought to fathom the Things of God in and by
this natural and rational Principle, and to build up a Religion in
it, neglecting and overlooking this Principle and Seed of God in the
Heart;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Anti-Christ in the Temple of God.</i></span>so that herein, in the most universal and catholick Sense,
hath <i>Anti-Christ in every Man set up himself, and sitteth in the Temple of God
as God, and above every Thing that is called God</i>. For <i>Men being the Temple
of the Holy Ghost</i>, as saith the Apostle, 1 <i>Cor.</i> iii. 16. when the rational
Principle sets up itself there above the Seed of God, to reign and
rule as a Prince in spiritual Things, while the Holy Seed is wounded
and bruised, there is <i>Anti-Christ in every Man</i>, or somewhat exalted
above and against Christ. Nevertheless we do not hereby affirm as
if Man had received his Reason to no Purpose, or to be of no Service
unto him, in no wise; we look upon Reason as fit to order and
rule Man in Things natural.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Divine Light and natural Reason distinguished.</i></span>For as God gave two great Lights to
rule the outward World, the Sun and Moon, the greater Light to rule
the Day, and the lesser Light to rule the Night; so hath he given Man
the Light of his Son, a Spiritual Divine Light, to rule him in Things
Spiritual, and the Light of Reason to rule him in Things Natural.
And even as the Moon borrows her Light from the Sun, so ought
Men, if they would be rightly and comfortably ordered in natural
Things, to have their Reason enlightened by this divine and pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
Light. Which enlightened Reason, in those that obey and follow
this true Light, we confess may be useful to Man even in Spiritual
Things, as it is still subservient and subject to the other; even as
the animal Life in Man, regulated and ordered by his Reason, helps
him in going about Things that are rational.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light distinguished from Man’s natural Conscience.</i></span>We do further rightly
distinguish this from Man’s natural Conscience; for Conscience being
that in Man which ariseth from the natural Faculties of Man’s
Soul, may be defiled and corrupted. It is said expresly of the Impure,
<i>Tit.</i> i. 15. <i>That even their Mind and Conscience is defiled</i>; but this
Light can never be corrupted nor defiled; neither did it ever consent
to Evil or Wickedness in any: For it is said expresly, that <i>it
makes all Things manifest that are reproveable</i>, Ephes. v. 13. and so is a
faithful Witness for God against every Unrighteousness <i>in Man</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Conscience defined.</i></span>Now
<i>Conscience</i>, to define it truly, comes from [<i>Conscire</i>,] and <i>is that Knowledge
which ariseth in Man’s Heart, from what agreeth, contradicteth, or is
contrary to any Thing believed by him, whereby he becomes conscious to himself
that he transgresseth by doing that which he is persuaded he ought not to do</i>.
So that the Mind being once blinded or defiled with a wrong Belief,
there ariseth a Conscience from that Belief, which troubles him when
he goes against it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Example of a</i> Turk.</span>As for Example: A <i>Turk</i> who hath possessed
himself with a false Belief that it is unlawful for him to drink Wine,
if he do it, his Conscience smites him for it; but though he keep
many Concubines, his Conscience troubles him not, because his
Judgment is already defiled with a false Opinion that it is lawful for
him to do the one, and unlawful to do the other. Whereas if the
Light of Christ in him were minded, it would reprove him, not only
for committing Fornication, but also, as he became obedient thereunto,
inform him that <i>Mahomet</i> was an <i>Impostor</i>; as well as <i>Socrates</i>
was informed by it, in his Day, of the Falsity of the Heathens
Gods.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Example of a</i> Papist.</span>So if a <i>Papist</i> eat Flesh in <i>Lent</i>, or be not diligent enough in Adoration
of Saints and Images, or if he should contemn Images, his Conscience
would smite him for it, because his Judgment is already blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
with a false Belief concerning these Things: Whereas the Light of
Christ never consented to any of those Abominations. Thus then
Man’s natural Conscience is sufficiently distinguished from it; for Conscience
followeth the Judgment, doth not inform it; but this Light,
as it is received, removes the Blindness of the Judgment, opens the
Understanding, and rectifies both the Judgment and Conscience. So
we confess also, that Conscience is an excellent Thing, where it is
rightly informed and enlightened: Wherefore some of us have fitly
compared it to the Lanthorn, and the Light of Christ to a Candle:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The natural </i>Conscience<i> compared to a </i>Lanthorn<i>, and the Light of Christ is a</i> Candle.</span>A Lanthorn is useful, when a clear Candle burns and shines in it;
but otherwise of no Use. To the Light of Christ then in the Conscience,
and not to Man’s natural Conscience, it is that we continually
commend Men; this, not that, is it which we preach up,
and direct People to, as to a most certain Guide unto Life eternal.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, This <i>Light</i>, <i>Seed</i>, &amp;c. appears to be no Power or natural
Faculty of Man’s Mind; because a Man that is in his Health can,
when he pleases, stir up, move, and exercise the Faculties of his
Soul; he is absolute Master of them; and except there be some
natural Cause or Impediment in the Way, he can use them at his
Pleasure: But this <i>Light and Seed of God in Man</i> he cannot move and
stir up when he pleaseth; but it moves, blows, and strives with Man,
as the Lord seeth meet.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Waiting upon the Movings of the Light and Grace.</i></span>For though there be a Possibility of Salvation
to every Man during the Day of his Visitation, yet cannot a
Man, at any Time when he pleaseth, or hath some Sense of his <i>Misery</i>,
stir up that Light and Grace, so as to procure to himself Tenderness
of Heart; but he must wait for it: Which comes upon all at
certain Times and Seasons, wherein it works powerfully upon the
Soul, mightily tenders it, and breaks it; at which Time, if Man
resist it not, but closes with it, he comes to know Salvation by it.
Even as the Lake of <i>Bethesda</i> did not cure all those that washed in it,
but such only as washed first after the Angel had moved upon the
Waters; so God moves in Love to Mankind, in this Seed in his
Heart, at some singular Times, setting his Sins in Order before him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
and seriously inviting him to Repentance, offering to him Remission
of Sins and Salvation; which if Man accept of, he may be saved.
Now there is no Man alive, and I am confident there shall be none
to whom this Paper shall come, who, if they will deal faithfully and
honestly with their own Hearts, will not be forced to acknowledge
that they have been sensible of this in some Measure, less or more;
which is a Thing that Man cannot bring upon himself with all his
Pains and Industry. This then, O Man and Woman! is the Day of
God’s gracious Visitation to thy Soul, which if thou resist not, thou
shalt be happy for ever. This is the Day of the Lord, which, as
Christ saith, <a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a><i>is like the Lightning, which shineth from the East unto the
West</i>; and the <a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><i>Wind </i>or<i> Spirit, which blows upon the Heart, and no Man

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 7.</span>And lastly, This leads me to speak concerning the Manner
<i>of this Seed</i> or <i>Light’s Operation in the Hearts of all Men</i>, which will shew
yet more manifestly how widely we differ from all those that exalt a
natural Power or Light in Man; and how our Principle leads above
all others to attribute our whole Salvation to the mere Power, Spirit,
and Grace of God.</div>

<p>To them then that ask us after this Manner, <i>How do ye offer from
the</i> Pelagians <i>and</i> Arminians? <i>For if two Men have equal sufficient Light
and Grace, and the one be saved by it, and the other not; is it not because
the one improves it, the other not? Is not then the Will of Man the Cause of
the one’s Salvation beyond the other</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light’s Operations in Order to Salvation.</i></span>I say, to such we thus answer: That
as the Grace and Light in all is sufficient to save all, and of its own
Nature would save all; so it strives and wrestles with all in order to
save them; he that resists its Striving, is the Cause of his own Condemnation;
he that resists it not, it becomes his Salvation: So that
in him that is saved, the working is of the <i>Grace</i>, and not of the
<i>Man</i>; and it is a Passiveness rather than an Act; though afterwards,
as Man is wrought upon, there is a Will raised in him, by which he
comes to be a Co-worker with the Grace: For according to that of
<i>Augustine</i>, <i>He that made us without us, will not save us without us</i>. So that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
the first Step is not by Man’s working, but by his not contrary
working. And we believe, that at these singular Seasons of every
Man’s Visitation above-mentioned, as Man is wholly unable of himself
to work with the Grace, neither can he move one Step out of the
natural Condition, until the Grace lay hold upon him; so it is possible
for him to be passive, and not to resist it, as it is <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: possible to">possible for him to</span> resist it. So
we say, the Grace of God works in and upon Man’s Nature; which,
though of itself wholly corrupted and defiled, and prone to Evil, yet
is capable to be wrought upon by the Grace of God; even as Iron,
though an hard and cold Metal of itself, may be warmed and softened
by the Heat of the Fire, and Wax melted by the Sun. And as Iron
or Wax, when removed from the Fire or Sun, returneth to its former
Condition of Coldness and Hardness; so Man’s Heart, as it resists
or retires from the Grace of God, returns to its former Condition again.
I have often had the Manner of God’s working, in order to Salvation
towards all Men, illustrated to my Mind by one or two clear
Examples, which I shall here add for the Information of others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Example of a Diseased Man and the Physician.</i></span>The first is, <i>Of a Man heavily diseased</i>; to whom I compare Man in
his fallen and natural Condition. I suppose God, who is the great
Physician, not only to give this Man Physick, after he hath used all
the Industry he can for his own Health, by any Skill or Knowledge
of his own; as those that say, <i>If a Man improve his Reason or natural
Faculties, God will superadd Grace</i>; <i>or, </i>as others say,<i> That he cometh and
maketh Offer of a Remedy to this Man outwardly, leaving it to the Liberty of
Man’s Will either to receive it or reject it</i>. But He, even the Lord, this
great Physician, cometh, and poureth the Remedy into his Mouth,
and as it were layeth him in his Bed; so that if the sick Man be but
passive, it will necessarily work the Effect: But if he be stubborn and
untoward, and will needs rise up and go forth into the Cold, or eat
such Fruits as are hurtful to him, while the <i>Medicine</i> should operate;
then, though of its Nature it tendeth to cure him, yet it will prove
destructive to him, because of those Obstructions which it meeteth
with. Now as the Man that should thus undo himself would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
be the Cause of his own Death; so who will say, that, if
cured, he owes not his Health wholly to the Physician, and not to
any Deed of his own; seeing his Part was not any Action, but a
Passiveness?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Example of </i>Men<i> lying stupified in a dark </i>Pit<i>, and their </i>Deliverer.</span>The second Example is, <i>Of divers Men lying in a dark Pit together,
where all their Senses are so stupified, that they are scarce sensible of their own
Misery</i>. To this I compare Man in his natural, corrupt, fallen Condition.
I suppose not that any of these Men, wrestling to deliver
themselves, do thereby stir up or engage one able to deliver them to
give them his Help, saying within himself, <i>I see one of these Men willing
to be delivered, and doing what in him lies, therefore he deserves to be
assisted</i>; as say the <i>Socinians</i>, <i>Pelagians</i>, and <i>Semi-Pelagians</i>. Neither do
I suppose that this Deliverer comes to the Top of the Pit, and puts
down a Ladder, desiring them that will to come up; and so puts
them upon using their own Strength and Will to come up; as do
the <i>Jesuits</i> and <i>Arminians</i>: Yet, as they say, such are not delivered
without the Grace; seeing the Grace is that Ladder by which they
were delivered. But I suppose that the Deliverer comes at certain
Times, and fully discovers and informs them of the great Misery and
Hazard they are in, if they continue in that noisome and pestiferous
Place; yea, forces them to a certain Sense of their Misery (for the
wickedest Men at Times are made sensible of their Misery by God’s
Visitation) and not only so, but lays Hold upon them, and gives
them a Pull, in order to lift them out of their Misery; which if they
resist not will save them; only they may resist it. This being applied
as the former, doth the same Way illustrate the Matter. Neither is
the Grace of God frustrated, though the Effect of it be divers, according
to its Object, being the <i>Ministration of Mercy and Love</i> in those
that reject it not, but receive it, <i>John</i> i. 12. but the <i>Ministration of
Wrath and Condemnation</i> in those that do reject it, <i>John</i> iii. 19.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A </i>Simile<i> of the Sun’s melting and hardening Power.</i></span>even as
the Sun, by one Act or Operation, melteth and softeneth the Wax,
and hardeneth the Clay. The Nature of the Sun is to cherish the Creation,
and therefore the Living are refreshed by it, and the Flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
send forth a good Savour, as it shines upon them, and the Fruits of
the Trees are ripened; yet cast forth a dead Carcase, a Thing without
Life, and the same Reflection of the Sun will cause it to stink,
and putrify it; yet is not the Sun said thereby to be frustrated of its
proper Effect. So every Man during the Day of his Visitation is
shined upon by the Sun of Righteousness, and capable of being influenced
by it, so as to send forth good Fruit, and a good Savour, and
to be melted by it; but when he hath sinned out his Day, then the
same Sun hardeneth him, as it doth the Clay, and makes his Wickedness
more to appear and putrify, and send forth an evil Savour.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>All have Grace sufficient for Salvation given them of God.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, As we truly affirm that God willeth no Man to
perish, and therefore hath given to all Grace sufficient for Salvation;
so we do not deny, but that in a special Manner he worketh in some,
in whom Grace so prevaileth, that they necessarily obtain Salvation;
neither doth God suffer them to resist. For it were absurd to say,
that God had not far otherwise extended himself towards the Virgin
<i>Mary</i> and the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, than towards many others: Neither can
we affirm, that God equally loved the beloved Disciple <i>John</i> and <i>Judas</i>
the Traitor; yet so far, nevertheless, as none wanted such a Measure
of Grace by which they might have been saved, all are justly
inexcusable. And also God working in those to whom this Prevalency
of Grace is given, doth so hide himself, to shut out all Security and
Presumption, that such may be humbled, and the free Grace of God
magnified, and all reputed to be of the free Gift; and nothing from
the Strength of Self. Those also who perish, when they remember
those Times of God’s Visitation towards them, wherein he wrestled
with them by his <i>Light</i> and <i>Spirit</i>, are forced to confess, that there
was a Time wherein the Door of Mercy was open unto them, and
that they are justly condemned, because they rejected their own Salvation.</div>

<p>Thus both the Mercy and Justice of God are established, and the
Will and Strength of Man are brought down and rejected; his Condemnation
is made to be of himself, and his Salvation only to de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>pend
upon God. Also, by these Positions, two great Objections,
which often are brought against this Doctrine, are well solved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>The first is deduced from those Places of Scripture, wherein God
seems precisely to have decreed and predestinated some to Salvation;
and for that End, to have ordained certain Means, which fall not
out to others; as in the Calling of <i>Abraham</i>, <i>David</i>, and others, and
in the Conversion of <i>Paul</i>; for these being numbered among such to
whom this Prevalency is given, the Objection is easily loosed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Predestination to Salvation, and Pre-ordination to Destruction</i>, answered.</span>The second is drawn from those Places, wherein God seems to have
ordained some wicked Persons to Destruction; and therefore to have
obdured their Hearts to force them unto great Sins, and to have raised
them up, that he might shew in them his Power, who, if they be
numbered amongst those Men whose Day of Visitation is passed over,
that Objection is also solved; as will more evidently appear to any
One that will make a particular Application of those Things, which
I at this Time, for Brevity’s Sake, thought meet to pass over.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIX.</h3> Having thus clearly and evidently stated the Question,
and opened our Mind and Judgment in this Matter, as divers Objections
are hereby prevented, so will it make our Proof both the easier
and the shorter.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. I.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>
The first Thing to be proved is, <i>That God hath given to every Man a
Day or Time of Visitation, wherein it is possible for him to be saved</i>. If we
can prove that there is a Day and Time given, in which those might
have been saved that actually perish, the Matter is done: For none
deny but those that are saved have a Day of Visitation.
<span class="sidenote">Proof I.</span>This then
appears by the Regrets and Complaints which the Spirit of God
throughout the whole Scriptures makes, even to those that did perish;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Those that perish, had a Day of Mercy offered them.</i></span>sharply reproving them, <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: for they">for that they</span> did not accept of, nor close with
God’s Visitation and Offer of Mercy to them. Thus the Lord expresses
himself then first of all to <i>Cain</i>, Gen. iv. 6, 7.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Instances.</i> 1. Cain.</span><i>And the Lord
said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy Countenance fallen? If
thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted? If thou dost not well, Sin lieth at
the Door.</i> This was said to <i>Cain</i> before he slew his Brother <i>Abel</i>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
the evil Seed began to tempt him, and work in his Heart; we see
how God gave Warning to <i>Cain</i> in Season, and in the Day of his
Visitation towards him, Acceptance and Remission if he did well:
For this Interrogation, <i>Shalt thou not be accepted?</i> imports an Affirmative,
<i>Thou shalt be accepted, if thou dost well</i>. So that if we may trust
God Almighty, the Fountain of all Truth and Equity, it was possible
in a Day, even for <i>Cain</i> to be accepted. Neither could God
have proposed the doing of <i>Good</i> as a Condition, if he had not given
<i>Cain</i> sufficient Strength, whereby he was capable to do <i>Good</i>. This
the Lord himself also shews, even that he gave a Day of Visitation
to the Old World,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> Old World.</span><i>Gen.</i> vi. 3. <i>And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always
strive in Man</i>; for so it ought to be translated. This manifestly
implies, that his Spirit did strive with Man, and doth strive with him
for a Season, which Season expiring, God ceaseth to strive with him,
in order to save him: For the Spirit of God cannot be said to
strive with Man after the Day of his Visitation is expired; seeing it
naturally, and without any Resistance, works its Effect then, to wit,
continually to judge and condemn him. From this <i>Day of Visitation</i>,
that God hath given to every One, is it, that he is said to <i>wait to be
gracious</i>, Isa. xxx. 18.
<span class="sidenote"><i>God is Long-suffering, and long waiting to be gracious unto all</i>.&mdash;</span>And to be <i>Long-suffering</i>, Exod. xxxiv. 6. Numb.
xiv. 18. Psal. lxxxvi. 15. Jer. xv. 15. Here the Prophet <i>Jeremy</i>, in his
Prayer, lays hold upon the <i>Long-suffering of God</i>; and in his expostulating
with God, he shuts out the Objection of our Adversaries in
the 18th Verse; <i>Why is my Pain perpetual, and my Wound incurable, which
refuseth to be healed? Wilt thou altogether be unto me as a Liar, and as Waters
that fail?</i> Whereas, according to our Adversaries Opinion, the
Pain of the most Part of Men is perpetual, and their Wound altogether
incurable; yea, the Offer of the Gospel, and of Salvation unto
them, is as a Lie, and as Waters that fail, being never intended to
be of any Effect unto them. The Apostle <i>Peter</i> says expresly, that
this <i>Long-suffering of God waited in the Days of </i>Noah<i> for those of the Old
World</i>, 1 Pet. iii. 20. which, being compared with that of <i>Gen.</i> vi. 3.
before-mentioned, doth sufficiently hold forth our Proposition. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
that none may object that this <i>Long-suffering</i> or <i>Striving of the Lord</i>
was not in order to save them, the same Apostle saith expresly, 2 <i>Pet.</i>
iii. 15.
<span class="sidenote"><i>In order to save them.</i></span><i>That the Long-suffering of God is to be accounted Salvation</i>; and with
this <i>Long-suffering</i>, a little before in the 9th Verse, he couples, <i>That
God is not willing that any should perish</i>. Where, taking him to be his
own Interpreter (as he is most fit) he holdeth forth, That those to
whom the Lord is <i>Long-suffering</i>, (which he declareth he was to the
Wicked of the Old World, and is now to all, <i>not willing that any
should perish</i>) they are <i>to account this Long-suffering of God to them Salvation</i>.
Now, how or in what respect can they account it <i>Salvation</i>, if
there be not so much as a <i>Possibility</i> of <i>Salvation</i> conveyed to them
therein? For it were not <i>Salvation</i> to them, if they could not be
saved by it. In this Matter <i>Peter</i> further refers to the Writings of
<i>Paul</i>, holding forth this to have been the universal Doctrine. Where
it is observable what he adds upon this Occasion,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Some Things in </i>Paul<i>’s Epistles hard to be understood.</i></span>how <i>there are some
Things in </i>Paul<i>’s Epistles hard to be understood, which the Unstable and Unlearned
wrest to their own Destruction</i>; insinuating plainly this of those
Expressions in <i>Paul</i>’s Epistles, as <i>Rom.</i> ix. <i>&amp;c.</i> which some, <i>unlearned</i>
in spiritual Things, did make to contradict the Truth of <i>God’s Long-suffering
towards all</i>, in which he willeth not any of them should perish,
and in which they all may be saved. Would to God many had
taken more Heed than they have done to this Advertisement! That
Place of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, which <i>Peter</i> seems here most particularly
to hint at, doth much contribute also to clear the Matter, <i>Rom.</i> ii. 4.
<i>Despisest thou the Riches of his Goodness, and Forbearance, and Long-suffering,
not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to Repentance?</i> <i>Paul</i> speaketh
here to the Unregenerate, and to the Wicked, who (in the following
<i>Verse</i> he saith) <i>Treasure up Wrath unto the Day of Wrath</i>; and to such
he commends the Riches of the Forbearance and Long-suffering of
God; shewing that the Tendency of God’s Goodness leadeth to Repentance.
How could it necessarily tend to <i>lead them to Repentance</i>,
how could it be called <i>Riches</i> or <i>Goodness</i> to them, if there were not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
Time wherein they might repent by it, and come to be Sharers of
the Riches exhibited in it? From all which I thus argue.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>God’s Spirit strives in the Wicked.</i></span>
If God plead with the Wicked, from the Possibility of their being
accepted; if God’s Spirit strive in them for a Season, in order to
save them, who afterwards perish; if he wait to be gracious unto them;
if he be Long-suffering towards them; and if this Long-suffering be
Salvation to them while it endureth, during which Time God
willeth them not to perish, but exhibiteth to them the Riches of his
Goodness and Forbearance to lead them to Repentance; then there
is a Day of Visitation wherein such might have been, or some such
now may be saved, who have perished; and may perish, if they
repent not:</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the last.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 2.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This appeareth from the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i> v. 4.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Vineyard planted brought forth wild Grapes.</i></span><i>What could I have done more to my Vineyard?</i> For in Ver. 2. he saith;
<i>He had fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof, and planted it with the
choicest Vine: And yet </i>(saith he)<i> when I looked it should have brought forth
Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes</i>. Wherefore he calleth the Inhabitants
of <i>Jerusalem</i>, and Men of <i>Judah</i>, to judge betwixt him and his Vineyard,
saying; <i>What could I have done more to my Vineyard, than I have
done in it? and yet </i>(as is said)<i> it brought forth wild Grapes</i>: Which was
applied to many in <i>Israel</i>, who refused God’s Mercy. The same Example
is used by Christ, <i>Matth.</i> xxi. 33. <i>Mark</i> xii. 1. <i>Luke</i> xx. 9.
where <i>Jesus</i> shews, how to some <i>a Vineyard was planted</i>, and all Things
given necessary for them, to get them Fruit to pay or restore to their
Master; and how the Master many Times waited to be merciful to
them, in sending Servants after Servants, and passing by many Offences,
before he determined to destroy and cast them out. <i>First</i>
then, this cannot be understood of the Saints, or of such as repent
and are saved; for it is said expresly, <i>He will destroy them</i>. Neither
would the Parable any ways have answered the End for which it is
alleged, if these Men had not been in a Capacity to have done Good;
yea, such was their Capacity, that Christ saith in the Prophet, <i>What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
could have I done more?</i> So that it is more than manifest, that by this
Parable, repeated in three sundry <i>Evangelists</i>, Christ holds forth his
Long-suffering towards Men, and their Wickedness, to whom Means
of Salvation being afforded, do nevertheless resist, to their own Condemnation.
To these also are parallel these Scriptures, <i>Prov.</i> i. 24,
25, 26. <i>Jer.</i> xviii. 9, 10. <i>Matth.</i> xviii. 32, 33, 34. <i>Acts</i> xiii. 46.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 3.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, That there is a Day of Visitation given to the Wicked,
wherein they might have been saved, and which being expired, they
are shut out from Salvation,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s Lamentation over</i> Jerusalem.</span>appears evidently by Christ’s Lamentation
over <i>Jerusalem</i>, expressed in three sundry Places, <i>Matth.</i> xxiii. 37.
<i>Luke</i> xiii. 34. and xix. 41, 42. <i>And when he was come near, he beheld the
City, and wept over it, saying; If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in
this thy Day, the Things that belong to thy Peace; but now they are hid from
thine Eyes!</i> Than which nothing can be said more evident to prove
our Doctrine. For, <i>First</i>, he insinuates that there was a Day wherein
the Inhabitants of <i>Jerusalem</i> might have known those Things that
belonged to their Peace. <i>Secondly</i>, That during that Day he was
willing to have gathered them, even as an <i>Hen gathereth her Chickens</i>.
A familiar Example, yet very significative in this Case; which shews
that the Offer of Salvation made unto them was not in vain on his
Part, but as really, and with as great Chearfulness and Willingness,
as an <i>Hen gathereth her Chickens</i>. Such as is the Love and Care of the
Hen toward her Brood, such is the Care of Christ to gather lost Men
and Women, to redeem them out of their corrupt and degenerate
State. <i>Thirdly</i>, That because they refused, the Things belonging to
their <i>Peace were hid from their Eyes</i>. Why were they hid? Because ye
would not suffer me to <i>gather you</i>; ye would not see those Things
that were <i>good for you</i>, in the Season of God’s Love towards you;
and therefore <i>now</i>, that Day being expired, <i>ye cannot see them</i>: And,
for a farther judgment, God suffers you to be hardened in Unbelief.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>God hardens, when.</i></span>So it is, after real Offers of Mercy and Salvation rejected, that Men’s
Hearts are hardened, and not before. Thus that Saying is verified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
<i>To him that hath, shall be given; and from him that hath not, shall be taken
away even that which he hath.</i> This may seem a Riddle, yet it is according
to this Doctrine easily solved. He hath not, because he hath
lost the Season of using it, and so to him it is now as nothing; for
Christ uses this Expression, <i>Matth.</i> xxv. 26.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The one Talent was sufficient.</i></span>upon the Occasion of the
taking the <i>one Talent</i> from the <i>slothful Servant</i>, and giving it to him
that was diligent; which <i>Talent</i> was no ways insufficient of itself,
but of the same Nature with those given to the others; and therefore
the Lord had Reason to exact the Profit of it proportionably, as well
as from the rest: So, I say, it is after the rejecting of the Day of Visitation,
that the Judgment of Obduration is inflicted upon Men and
Women, as Christ pronounceth it upon the <i>Jews</i> out of <i>Isa.</i> vi. 9.
which all the four <i>Evangelists</i> make Mention of, <i>Matth.</i> xiii. 14. <i>Mark</i>
iv. 12. <i>Luke</i> viii. 10. <i>John</i> xii. 40. and last of all the Apostle <i>Paul</i>,
after he had made Offer of the Gospel of Salvation to the <i>Jews</i> at
<i>Rome</i>, pronounceth the same, <i>Acts</i> xxviii. 26. after that some believed
not; <i>Well spake the Holy Ghost, by </i>Isaiah<i> the Prophet, unto our Fathers, saying,
Go unto this People, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For the Heart of this
People is waxed gross, and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes have
they closed; lest they should see with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and
understand with their Hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal
them.</i> So it appears, that God would have them to see, but they
closed their Eyes; and therefore they are justly hardened.
<span class="sidenote">Cyril. Alex.</span>Of this
Matter <i>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</i> upon <i>John</i>, Lib. 6. Cap. 21. speaks well,
answering to this Objection. <i>But some may say, If Christ be come into
the World, that those that see may be blinded, their Blindness is not imputed
unto them; but it rather seems that Christ is the Cause of their Blindness, who
saith</i>, He is come into the World, that those that see may be blinded.
<i>But, </i>saith he,<i> they speak not rationally, who object these Things unto God,
and are not afraid to call him the Author of Evil. For, as the sensible Sun
is carried upon our Horizon, that it may communicate the Gift of its Clearness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
unto all, and make its Light shine upon all</i>; <span class="sidenote"><i>The Cause of Man’s remaining in Darkness, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: the closing his eyes">the closing
of his Eyes</span>.</i></span><i>yet if any one close his Eye-lids,
or willingly turn himself from the Sun, refusing the Benefit of its Light, he
wants its Illumination, and remains in Darkness, not through the Defect of the
Sun, but through his own Fault. So that the true Sun, who came to enlighten
those that sat in Darkness, and in the Region of the Shadow of Death, visited
the Earth for this Cause, that he might communicate unto all the Gift of Knowledge
and Grace, and illuminate the inward Eyes of all by a spiritual Splendor:
But many reject the Gift of this heavenly Light freely given to them, and have
closed the Eyes of their Minds, lest so excellent an Illumination or Irradiation
of the eternal Light should shine unto them. It is not then through Defect of
the true Sun that they are blinded, but only through their own Iniquity and
Hardness</i>; for, <i>as the wise Man saith, Wisdom</i> ii. Their Wickedness hath
blinded them.</p>

<p>From all which I thus argue:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The obstinate </i>Jews<i> had a Day.</i></span>If there was a Day wherein the obstinate <i>Jews</i> might have known
the Things that <i>belonged to their Peace</i>, which, because they rejected
it, <i>was hid from their Eyes</i>; if there was a Time wherein Christ would
have gathered them, who, because they refused, could not be gathered;
then such as might have been saved do actually perish, that
slighted the Day of God’s Visitation towards them, wherein they
might have been converted and saved.</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the last.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Prop. II.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, That which comes in the second Place to be
proved is, <i>That whereby God offers to work this Salvation during the Day
of every Man’s Visitation</i>; and that is, <i>That he hath given to every Man a
Measure of saving, sufficient, and supernatural Light and Grace</i>. This I
shall do, by God’s Assistance, by some plain and clear Testimonies
of the Scripture.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Proof 1.</i></span><i>First</i>, From that of <i>John</i> i. 9. <i>That was the true Light, which lighteth
every Man that cometh into the World</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light enlightening every Man</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;</span>This Place doth so clearly favour
us, that by some it is called the <i>Quakers Text</i>; for it doth evidently
demonstrate our Assertion; so that it scarce needs either Consequence
or Deduction, seeing itself is a Consequence of two Propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
asserted in the former Verses, from which it followeth as a Conclusion
in the very Terms of our Faith. The first of these Propositions
is, <i>The Life that is in him is the Light of Men</i>: The second, <i>The Light
shineth in the Darkness</i>; And from these two he infers, and <i>He is the true
Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obs. 1.</span>From whence I do in short observe, That this divine Apostle calls
<i>Christ the Light of Men</i>, and giveth us this as one of the chief Properties,
at least considerably and especially to be observed by us; seeing
hereby, as he is the <i>Light</i>, and as we walk with him in that <i>Light</i>
which he communicates to us, we come to have Fellowship and
Communion with him; as the same Apostle saith elsewhere, 1 <i>John</i>
i. 7. <i>Secondly</i>, That <i>this Light shineth in Darkness, though the Darkness
comprehend it not</i>.
<span class="sidenote">&mdash;<i>Not to a certain Number of Men, but every Man.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, That <i>this true Light enlighteneth every Man
that cometh into the World</i>. Where the Apostle, being directed by God’s
Spirit, hath carefully avoided their Captiousness, that would have
restricted this to any certain Number: Where every one is, there is
none excluded. Next, should they be so obstinate, as sometimes
they are, as to say that this [<i>every Man</i>] is only every one of the
Elect; these Words following, <i>every Man that cometh into the World</i>,
would obviate that Objection. So that it is plain there comes no
Man into the World, whom Christ hath not <i>enlightened</i> in some Measure,
and in whose dark Heart this <i>Light</i> doth not shine; though the
<i>Darkness comprehend it not</i>, yet it shineth there; and the Nature
thereof is to dispel the Darkness where Men shut not their Eyes upon
it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light dispelling Darkness begets Faith.</i></span>Now for what End this <i>Light</i> is given, is expressed, Ver. 7. where
<i>John</i> is said to come for a <i>Witness, to bear Witness to the Light, that all
Men through it might believe</i>; to wit, through the <i>Light</i>, [Greek: di autou: δι αυτου], which
doth very well agree with [Greek: phôtos: φωτος], as being the nearest Antecedent,
though most Translators have (to make it suit with their own Doctrine)
made it relate to <i>John</i>, as if all Men were to believe through
<i>John</i>. For which, as there is nothing directly in the Text, so it is contrary
to the very Strain of the Context. For, seeing Christ hath <i>lighted
every Man</i> with this <i>Light</i>, Is it not that they may come to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
through it? All could not believe through <i>John</i>, because all Men could
not know of <i>John</i>’s Testimony; whereas every Man being lighted by
this, may come <span class="correction" title="In the original book: there-through">therethrough</span> to believe. <i>John</i> shined not in <i>Darkness</i>;
but this <i>Light</i> shineth in the <i>Darkness</i>, that having dispelled the
<i>Darkness</i>, it may produce and beget Faith. And, <i>Lastly</i>, We must believe
through that, and become Believers through that, by walking in which,
Fellowship with God is known and enjoyed; but, as hath been above-observed,
it is by walking in this <i>Light</i> that we have this Communion
and Fellowship; not by walking in <i>John</i>, which were Nonsense. So that
this Relative [Greek: di autou: δι αυτου], must needs be referred to the <i>Light</i>, whereof <i>John</i>
bears Witness, that through that <i>Light</i>, wherewith Christ hath <i>lighted
every Man</i>, all Men might come to believe. Seeing then this <i>Light</i> is the
<i>Light</i> of Jesus Christ, and the <i>Light</i> through which Men come to believe,
I think it needs not to be doubted, but that it is a supernatural,
saving, and sufficient <i>Light</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light is supernatural, saving, and sufficient.</i></span>If it were not supernatural, it
could not be properly called the <i>Light</i> of Jesus; for though all Things
be his, and of him, and from him; yet those Things which are
common and peculiar to our Nature, as being a Part of it, we are
not said in so special a Manner to have from Christ. Moreover, the
Evangelist is holding out to us here the Office of Christ as Mediator,
and the Benefits which from him as such do redound unto us.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obser. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, It cannot be any of the natural Gifts or Faculties of our
Soul, whereby we are said here to be enlightened, because this Light
is said to <i>shine in the Darkness</i>, and cannot be comprehended by it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Darkness is Man’s natural State and Condition.</i></span>Now this Darkness is no other but Man’s natural Condition and
State; in which natural State he can easily comprehend, and doth
comprehend, those Things that are peculiar and common to him
as such. That Man in his natural Condition is called <i>Darkness</i>, see
<i>Eph.</i> v. 8. <i>For ye were sometimes Darkness, but now are ye Light in the
Lord.</i> And in other Places, as <i>Acts</i> xxvi. 18. <i>Col.</i> i. 3. 1 <i>Thess.</i> v. 5.
where the Condition of Man in his natural State, is termed <i>Darkness</i>:
Therefore, I say, this <i>Light</i> cannot be any natural Property or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
Faculty of Man’s Soul, but a supernatural Gift and Grace of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obser. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, It is sufficient and saving.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 1.</span>That which is given, <i>That all Men through it may believe</i>, must needs
be saving and sufficient: That, by walking in which, Fellowship
with the Saints and the Blood of Christ, <i>Which cleanseth from all Sin</i>,
is possessed, must be sufficient:</p>

<p>But such is the <span class="smcap">Light</span>, 1 <i>John</i> i. 7.</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="in4">Moreover;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 2.</span>That which we are commanded to believe in, <i>That we may become
the Children of the Light</i>, must be a supernatural, sufficient and saving
Principle:</p>

<p>But we are commanded to <i>believe in this Light</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Proposition</i> cannot be denied. The <i>Assumption</i> is Christ’s own
Words, <i>John</i> xii. 36. <i>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that
ye may be the Children of the Light.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>To this they object, <i>That by </i>[Light]<i> here is understood Christ’s outward
Person, in whom he would have them believe.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>That they ought to have believed in Christ, that is, that he was
the <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> that was to come, is not denied;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether Christ’s outward Person was the Light?</i></span>but how they evince
that Christ intended <i>that</i> here, I see not: Nay, the Place itself shews
the Contrary, by these Words, <i>While ye have the Light</i>; and by the
Verse going before, <i>Walk while ye have the Light, lest Darkness come upon
you</i>: Which Words import, That when that Light in which they
were to believe was removed, then they should lose the Capacity or
Season of believing. Now this could not be understood of Christ’s
Person, else the <i>Jews</i> might have believed in him; and many did
savingly believe in him, as all Christians do at this Day, when the
Person, to wit, his bodily Presence, or outward Man, is far removed
from them.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Light of Christ is not Christ’s outward Man or Person.</i></span>So that this Light in which they were commanded
to believe must be that inward spiritual Light that shines in their
Hearts for a Season, even during the Day of Man’s Visitation; which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
while it continueth to call, invite, and exhort, Men are said to have
it, and may believe in it; but when Men refuse to believe in it, and
reject it, then it ceaseth to be a Light to shew them the Way; but
leaves the Sense of their Unfaithfulness as a Sting in their Conscience,
which is a Terror and Darkness unto them, and upon them,
in which they cannot know where to go, neither can work any
Ways profitably in order to their Salvation. And therefore to such
rebellious Ones the Day of the Lord is said to be <i>Darkness</i>, and not
<i>Light</i>, Amos v. 18.</p>

<p>From whence it appears, that though many receive not the Light,
as many comprehend it not, nevertheless this saving Light shines in
all, that it may save them.
<span class="sidenote">Cyrillus Alexandrinus<i> upon </i>John<i> Lib. 1. Chap. II.</i></span>Concerning which also <i>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</i>
saith well, and defends our Principle: “With great Diligence
and Watchfulness,” saith he, “doth the Apostle <i>John</i> endeavour
to anticipate and prevent the vain Thoughts of Men: For there is
here a wonderful Method of sublime Things, and overturning of
Objections. He had just now called the Son the <i>true Light</i>, by
whom he affirmed, That every Man coming into the World was
enlightened; yea, that he was in the World, and the World was
made by him. One may then object, If the Word of God be the
Light, and if this Light enlighten the Hearts of Men, and suggest
unto Men Piety and the Understanding of Things; if he was
always in the World, and was the Creator or Builder of the World,
why was he so long unknown unto the World? It seems rather to
follow because he was unknown to the World, therefore the
World was not enlightened by him, nor he totally Light. Lest
any should so object, he divinely infers [and the World knew him
not.]
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Sun enlightens: But Man through Negligence buries Illumination.</i></span>Let not the World,” saith he, “accuse the Word of God,
and his eternal Light, but its own Weakness; for the Sun enlightens,
but the Creature rejects the Grace that is given unto it,
and abuseth the Sharpness of Understanding granted it, by which it
might have naturally known God; and, as a Prodigal, hath turned
its Sight to the Creatures, neglecting to go forward, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
Laziness and Negligence buried the Illumination, and despised
this Grace. Which that the Disciple of <i>Paul</i> might not do, he
was commanded to watch; therefore it is to be imputed to their
Wickedness, who are illuminated, and not unto the Light. For as
albeit the Sun riseth upon all, yet he that is blind receiveth no Benefit
thereby; none thence can justly accuse the Brightness of the
Sun, but will ascribe the Cause of not seeing to the Blindness: So I
judge it is to be understood of the only begotten Son of God;
for he is the true Light, and sendeth forth his Brightness upon
all; but the God of this World, as <i>Paul</i> saith, hath blinded the
Minds of those that believe not, 2 <i>Cor.</i> iv. 4. that the Light of the
Gospel shine not unto them. We say then, that Darkness is come
upon Men, not because they are altogether deprived of Light,
for Nature retaineth still the Strength of Understanding divinely
given it, but because Man is dulled by an evil Habit, and become
worse, and hath made the Measure of Grace, in some respect,
to languish. When therefore the Like befalls Man, the <i>Psalmist</i>
justly prays, crying, <i>Open mine Eyes, that I may behold the wonderful
Things of thy Law</i>. For the Law was given that this Light might
be kindled in us, the Blearedness of the Eyes of our Minds being
wiped away, and the Blindness being removed which detained us in
our former Ignorance. By these Words then, the World is accused as
ungrateful and unsensible, not knowing its Author, nor bringing
forth the good Fruit of the <i>Illumination</i>; that it may now seem to
be said truly of all, which was of old said by the Prophet of the
<i>Jews</i>, I expected that it should have brought forth Grapes, but it
brought forth wild Grapes. For the good Fruit of the <i>Illumination</i>
was the Knowledge of the Only Begotten, as a Cluster hanging
from a fruitful Branch, <i>&amp;c.</i>”</p>

<p>From which it appears <i>Cyrillus</i> believed, That a <i>saving Illumination</i>
was given unto all.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Grace no natural Gift.</i></span>For as to what he speaks of Nature, he
understands it not of the common Nature of Man by itself, but of
that Nature which hath the Strength of Understanding <i>divinely</i> given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
it: For he understands this <i>universal Illumination</i> to be of the same
Kind with that <i>Grace</i> of which <i>Paul</i> makes Mention to <i>Timothy</i>, saying,
<i>Neglect not the Grace that is in thee.</i> Now it is not to be believed, that
<i>Cyrillus</i> was so ignorant as to judge that Grace to have been some
natural Gift.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof II.</span>That this saving Light and Seed, or a Measure of it, is
given to all, Christ tells us expresly in the Parable of the Sower, <i>Mat.</i>
xiii. from Ver. 18. <i>Mark</i> iv. and <i>Luke</i> viii. 11. he saith,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Seed of the Kingdom is sown in several Sorts of Ground, without Distinction.</i></span>That this
<i>Seed</i>, sown in those several Sorts of Ground is the <i>Word of the Kingdom</i>,
which the Apostle calls the <i>Word of Faith</i>, Rom. x. 8. James i.
21.[Greek: ho Logos emphytos: ὁ Λογος εμφυτος], <i>the implanted ingrafted Word, which is able to save
the Soul</i>; the Words themselves declare that it is that which is <i>saving</i>
in the Nature of it, for in the good Ground it fructified abundantly.</div>

<p>Let us then observe, That this Seed of the Kingdom, this saving,
supernatural, and sufficient <i>Word</i>, was really sown in the stony,
thorny Ground, and by the Way-side, where it did not profit, but
became useless as to these Grounds: It was, I say, the same <i>Seed</i>
that was sown in the good Ground. It is then the Fear of Persecution
and Deceitfulness of Riches, as Christ himself interpreteth the
Parable, which hindereth this Seed to grow in the Hearts of many:
Not but that in its own Nature it is sufficient, being the same with
that which groweth up and prospereth in the Hearts of those who receive
it. So that, though all are not saved by it, yet there is a Seed
of Salvation planted and sown in the Hearts of <i>all</i> by God, which
would grow up and redeem the Soul, if it were not choked and
hindered. Concerning this Parable, <i>Victor Antiochenus</i>, on <i>Mark</i> iv. as
he is cited by <i>Vossius</i>, in his <i>Pelagian History</i>, Book 7. saith, “That
our Lord Christ hath liberally sown the divine Seed of the Word,
and proposed it to all, without Respect of Persons; and as he that
soweth distinguisheth not betwixt Ground and Ground, but
simply calleth in the Seed without Distinction, so our Saviour hath
offered the Food of the divine Word so far as was his Part, although
he was not ignorant what would become of many. <i>Lastly</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
He so behaved himself, as he might justly say, What should I have
done that I have not done?” And to this answered the Parable of
the <i>Talents</i>, Mat. xxv. he that had <i>two Talents</i> was accepted, as well
as he that had <i>five</i>, because he used them to his Master’s Profit: And
he that had <i>one</i> might have done so; his Talent was of the same
Nature of the rest; it was as capable to have proportionably brought
forth its Interest as the rest. And so though there be not a like
Proportion of Grace given to all, to some <i>five Talents</i>, to some <i>two
Talents</i>, and to some but <i>one Talent</i>; yet there is given to all that
which is sufficient, and no more is required than according to that
which is given: <i>For unto whomsoever much is given, from him shall much be
required</i>, Luke xii. 48. He that had the <i>two Talents</i> was accepted for
giving <i>four</i>, nothing less than he that gave the <i>ten</i>: So should he also
that gave the <i>one</i>, if he had given <i>two</i>; and no doubt <i>one</i> was capable
to have produced <i>two</i>, as well as <i>five</i> to have produced <i>ten</i>, or
<i>two four</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Pro. III.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Light is the Gospel, the Power of God, </i>preached<i> in every Creature under Heaven.</i></span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, This saving spiritual Light is the Gospel,
which the Apostle saith expresly, is preached <i>in every Creature under
Heaven</i>; even that very <i>Gospel whereof Paul was made a Minister</i>, Col.
i. 23. For the Gospel is not a mere Declaration of good Things,
being the <i>Power of God unto Salvation to all those that believe</i>, Rom. i. 16.
Though the outward Declaration of the Gospel be taken sometimes
for the Gospel; yet it is but figuratively, and by a <i>Metonymy</i>. For
to speak properly, the Gospel is this inward Power and Life which
preacheth <i>glad Tidings</i> in the Hearts of all Men, offering Salvation
unto them, and seeking to redeem them from their Iniquities, and
therefore it is said to be preached <i>in every Creature under Heaven</i>:
Whereas there are many Thousands of Men and Women, to whom
the outward Gospel was never preached. Therefore, the Apostle
<i>Paul</i>, <i>Romans</i> i. where he saith, <i>The Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation</i>,
adds, That <i>therein is revealed the Righteousness of God from Faith
to Faith</i>; and also the <i>Wrath of God against such as hold the Truth of God
in Unrighteousness</i>: For this Reason, saith he, <i>Because that which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them</i>. Now
that which may be known of God, is known by the Gospel, which
was manifest in them. For those of whom the Apostle speaks, had
no outward Gospel preached unto them; so that it was by the inward
Manifestation of the Knowledge of God <i>in them</i>, which is indeed
the Gospel preached in Men, <i>That the Righteousness of God is revealed
from Faith to Faith</i>; that is, it reveals to the Soul that which is
just, good, and righteous; and that as the Soul receiveth it, and believes,
Righteousness comes more and more to be revealed from one
Degree of Faith to another. For though, as the following Verse
saith, the outward Creation declares the Power of God; yet <i>that
which may be known of him is manifest within</i>: By which inward Manifestation,
we are made capable to see and discern the eternal Power and
Godhead in the outward Creation; so, were it not for this inward
Principle, we could no more understand the invisible Things of God by
the outward visible Creation, than a blind Man can see and discern
the Variety of Shapes and Colours, or judge of the Beauty of the outward
Creation. Therefore he saith, First, <i>That which may be known of
God is manifest in them</i>, and in and by that they may read and understand
the Power and Godhead in those Things that are outward and
visible. And though any might pretend that the outward Creation
doth of itself, without any supernatural or saving Principle in the
Heart, even declare to the natural Man that there is a God; yet
what would such a Knowledge avail, if it did not also communicate
to me what the Will of God is, and how I shall do that which is acceptable
to him?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>outward Creation<i> may beget a Persuasion in Man of an eternal Power or Virtue.</i></span>For the outward Creation, though it may beget a
Persuasion that there is some eternal Power or Virtue by which the
World hath had its Beginning; yet it doth not tell me, nor doth it
inform me of that which is just, holy, and righteous; how I shall
be delivered from my Temptations and evil Affections, and come
unto Righteousness; that must be from some inward Manifestation
in my Heart. Whereas those <i>Gentiles</i>, of whom the Apostle speaks,
knew by that <i>inward Law</i>, and Manifestation of the Knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
God in them to distinguish betwixt Good and Evil, as in the next
Chapter appears, of which we shall speak hereafter. The Prophet
<i>Micah</i>, speaking of Man indefinitely, or in general, declares this,
<i>Mic.</i> vi. 8. <i>He hath shewed thee, O Man, what is good. And what doth the
Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly
<span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: with God">with thy God</span>?</i> He doth not say God requires, till he hath first assured
that he hath shewed unto them. Now, because this is shewed unto
all Men, and manifest <i>in them</i>, therefore, saith the Apostle, is the
<i>Wrath of God revealed against them, for that they hold the Truth in Unrighteousness</i>;
that is, the Measure of Truth, the Light, the Seed,
the Grace <i>in them</i>: For that they <i>hide the Talent in the Earth</i>;
that is, in the earthly and unrighteous Part in their Hearts, and
suffer it not to bring forth Fruit, but to be choked with the sensual
Cares of this Life, the Fear of Reproach, and the Deceitfulness of
Riches, as by the Parables above-mentioned doth appear. But the
Apostle <i>Paul</i> opens and illustrates this Matter yet more, <i>Rom.</i> x. where
he declares, <i>That the Word which he preached</i> (now the Word which
he preached, and the Gospel which he preached, and whereof he was
a Minister, is one and the same) <i>is not far off, but nigh in the Heart
and in the Mouth</i>; which done, he frameth as it were the Objection
of our Adversaries in the 14th and 15th Verses, <i>How shall they believe
in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a
Preacher?</i> This he answers in the 18th Verse, saying, <i>But, I say,
have they not heard? Yes verily, their Sound went into all the Earth, and
their Words unto the Ends of the World</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The divine Preacher (the Word nigh) hath founded in the Ears and Hearts of all Men.</i></span>insinuating, that this divine
Preacher had founded in the Ears and Hearts of <i>all Men</i>: For of the
<i>outward Apostles</i> that Saying was not true, neither then, nor many
hundred Years after; yea, for aught we know, there may be yet
great and spacious Nations and Kingdoms that never have heard of
<i>Christ</i> nor his Apostles as outwardly. This inward and powerful
<i>Word of God</i> is yet more fully described in the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i>,
Chap. iv. 12, 13. <i>For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper
than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Discerner of the Thoughts and
Intents of the Heart.</i> The Virtues of this spiritual Word are here
enumerated: It is <i>quick</i>, because it <i>searches</i> and <i>tries the Hearts of all</i>;
no Man’s Heart is exempt from it: For the Apostle gives this Reason
of its being so, in the following Verse,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Before whom all Things are manifest.</i></span><i>But all Things are naked
and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do: And there is not
any Creature that is not manifest in his Sight.</i> Though this ultimately and
mediately be referred to God, yet nearly and immediately it relates
to the <i>Word</i> or <i>Light</i>, which, as hath been before proved, is <i>in the
Hearts of all</i>, else it had been improper to have brought it in here.
<span class="sidenote"><i>And every Thought and Intent of the Heart.</i></span>The Apostle shews how <i>every Intent and Thought of the Heart is discerned
by the Word of God</i>, because all Things are naked before God;
which imports nothing else but it is in and by this Word whereby
God sees and discerns Man’s Thoughts; and so it must needs be in
all Men, because the Apostle saith, <i>There is no Creature that is not manifest
in his Sight</i>.
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Faithful Witness</i>.</span>This then is that faithful <i>Witness</i> and <i>Messenger</i> of
God that bears Witness for God, and for his Righteousness in the
Hearts of all Men: <i>For he hath not left Man without a Witness</i>, Acts xiv.
17. and he is said to be <i>given for a Witness to the People</i>, Isa. lv. 4. And
as this Word beareth Witness for God, so it is not placed in Men
only to condemn them: For as he is given for a <i>Witness</i>, so saith the
Prophet, <i>He is given for a Leader and Commander</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Leader and Commander.</i></span><i>The Light is given,
that all through it may believe</i>, John i. 7. <i>For Faith cometh by Hearing, and
Hearing by the Word of God</i>, which is placed in Man’s Heart, both
to be a Witness for God, and to be a Means to bring Man to God
through Faith and Repentance: It is therefore <i>powerful</i>, that it may
divide betwixt the Soul and the Spirit:
<span class="sidenote"><i>A two-edged Sword.</i></span>It is like a <i>Two-edged Sword</i>,
that it may cut off Iniquity from him, and separate betwixt the Precious
and the Vile;
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Fire and a Hammer.</i></span>and because Man’s Heart is cold and hard like
Iron naturally, therefore hath God placed this Word <i>in him</i>, which
is said to be like a <i>Fire</i>, and like a <i>Hammer</i>, Jer. xxiii. 29. that like
as by the Heat of the Fire the Iron, of its own Nature cold, is
warmed and softened, and by the Strength of the Hammer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
framed according to the Mind of the Worker; so the cold and hard
Heart of Man is by the Virtue and Powerfulness of this Word of
God <i>near</i> and <i>in</i> the Heart, as it resists not, warmed and softened,
and receiveth an heavenly and cœlestial Impression and Image.
The most Part of the Fathers have spoken at large touching this
<i>Word</i>, <i>Seed</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>saving Voice</i>, calling all unto Salvation, and
able to save.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Clem. Alex.</span><i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i> saith, <i>Lib. 2. Stromat.</i> “The divine Word hath
cried, calling all, knowing well those that will not obey; and yet,
because it is in our Power either to obey or not to obey, that
none may have a Pretext of Ignorance, it hath made a righteous
Call, and requireth but that which is according to the Ability and
Strength of every one.” The self-same, in his Warning to the
<i>Gentiles</i>; “For as,” saith he, “that Heavenly Ambassador of the
Lord, <i>The Grace of God, that brings Salvation, hath appeared unto all</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> This is, the new Song, Coming and Manifestation of the
Word, which now shows itself in us, which was in the Beginning,
and was first of all.” And again, “Hear therefore, ye
that are afar off; hear, ye who are near; the Word is hid from
none, the Light is common to all, and shineth to all. There is
no Darkness in the <i>Word</i>; let us hasten to Salvation, to the new
Birth, that we being many, may be gathered into the one alone
Love.”
<span class="sidenote"><i>The gathering unto the one and alone Love.</i></span><i>Ibid.</i> he saith, “That there is infused into all, but principally
into those that are trained up in Doctrine, a certain <i>divine
Influence</i>, [Greek: tis achorrhoia theia: τις αχορῥοια θεια].” And again, he speaks concerning the
“<i>innate Witness</i>, worthy of Belief, which of itself doth plainly chuse
that which is most honest.” And again he saith, “That it is not
impossible to come unto the Truth, and lay Hold of it, seeing it
is most near to us, in our own Houses, as the most wise <i>Moses</i> declareth,
living in three Parts of us, <i>viz.</i> in our Hands, in our
Mouths, and in our Hearts. This,” saith he, “is a most true
Badge of the Truth, which is also fulfilled in three Things, namely,
in Counsel, in Action, in Speaking.” And again he saith also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
unto the unbelieving Nations, “Receive Christ, receive Light, receive
Sight, to the End thou mayest rightly know both God
and Man.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The enlightening Word.</i></span>The Word that hath enlightened us is more pleasant
than Gold, and the Stone of great Value.” And again, he saith,
“Let us receive the Light, that we may receive God; let us receive
the Light, that we may be the Scholars of the Lord.” And
again he saith to those Infidel Nations, “The heavenly Spirit helpeth
thee; resist and flee Pleasure.” Again, <i>Lib. 5. Strom.</i> he saith,
“God forbid that Man be not a Partaker of divine Acquaintance,
[Greek: theias ennoias: θειας εννοιας], who in <i>Genesis</i> is said to be a Partaker of Inspiration.”
And <i>Pæd. Lib. 1. Cap. 3</i>. “There is,” saith he, “some
lovely and some desirable Thing in Man, which is called the In-breathing
of God, [Greek: emphysêma Theou: εμφυσημα Θεου].” The same Man, <i>Lib. 10. Strom.</i>
directeth Men unto the <i>Light</i> and <i>Water</i> in themselves, who have the
Eye of the Soul darkened or dimmed through evil Education and
Learning: Let them enter in unto their own <i>domestic Light</i>, or unto
the <i>Light</i> which is in their own House, [Greek: pros to oikeion phôs badizetô: προς το οικειον φως βαδιζετω],
unto the <i>Truth</i>, which manifests accurately and clearly these Things
that have been written.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">J. Martyr.</span><i>Justin Martyr</i>, in his first <i>Apology</i>, saith, “That the Word which
was and is, is in all; even that very same Word which, through
the Prophets, foretold Things to come.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Auth. de Voc. Gent.</span>The Writer of the <i>Calling of the</i> Gentiles saith, <i>Lib. 1. Cap. 2</i>.
“We believe according to the same (<i>viz.</i> Scripture) and most religiously
confess, that God was never wanting in Care to the Generality
of Men; who, although he did lead, by particular Lessons,
a People gathered to himself unto Godliness, yet he withdrew
from no Nation of Men the Gifts of his own Goodness, that they
might be convinced that they had received the Words of the
Prophets, and legal Commands in Services and Testimonies of the
first Principles.” Cap. 7. he saith, “That he believes that the
Help of Grace hath been wholly withdrawn from no Man.” <i>Lib. 2.
Cap. 1.</i> “Because, albeit Salvation is far from Sinners, yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
is nothing void of the Presence and Virtue of his Salvation.” <i>Cap. 2.</i>
“But seeing none of that People over whom was set both the
Doctrines, were justified but through Grace by the Spirit of Faith,
who can question but that they, who of whatsoever Nation, in
whatsoever Times, could please God, were ordered by the Spirit
of the Grace of God, which, although in fore Time it was more
sparing and hid, yet denied itself to no Ages, being in Virtue one,
in Quantity different, in Counsel unchangeable, in Operation
multifarious.”</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXIV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Prop. III.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>
The third Proposition which ought to be proved, is,
<i>That it is by this Light, Seed, or Grace, that God works the Salvation of all
Men; and many come to partake of the Benefit of Christ’s Death, and Salvation
purchased by him.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>God’s Salvation </i>wrought<i> by the Light in all.</i></span>By the inward and effectual Operations of
which, as many <i>Heathens</i> have come to be Partakers of the Promises
who were not of the Seed of <i>Abraham</i> after the Flesh, so may some
now, to whom God hath rendered the Knowledge of the History
impossible, come to be saved by Christ. Having already proved
that <i>Christ</i> hath <i>died for all</i>, that there is a <i>Day of Visitation</i> given to <i>all</i>,
during which Salvation is possible to them, and that God hath actually
given a Measure of <i>saving Grace</i> and <i>Light</i> unto <i>all</i>, preached
the Gospel <i>to</i> and <i>in</i> them, and placed the <i>Word of Faith</i> in their
Hearts; the Matter of this Proposition may seem to be proved. Yet
shall I a little, for the farther Satisfaction of all who desire to know
the Truth, and hold it as it is in Jesus, prove this from two or
three clear Scripture Testimonies, and remove the most common as
well as the more strong Objections usually brought against it.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">1 Part.</span>Our Theme then hath two Parts; First, <i>That those that have the Gospel
and Christ outwardly preached unto them, are not saved but by the Working
of the Grace and Light in their Hearts</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">2 Part.</span>Secondly, <i>That by the Working and Operation of this, many have been,
and some may be saved, to whom the Gospel hath never been outwardly preached,
and who are utterly ignorant of the outward History of Christ</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">1 Part. <i>Proved.</i></span>As to the first, though it be granted by most, yet because it is more
in Words than Deeds (the more full discussing of which will occur in
the next Proposition concerning <i>Justification</i>) I shall prove it in few
Words. And first from the Words of Christ to <i>Nicodemus</i>, John iii. 3.
<i>Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The New Birth (or Regeneration) cometh not by the outward Knowledge of Christ.</i></span>Now this Birth cometh not by the outward Preaching
of the Gospel, or Knowledge of Christ, or historical Faith in him;
seeing many have that, and firmly believe it, who are never thus renewed.
The Apostle <i>Paul</i> also goes so far, while he commends the
Necessity and Excellency of this <i>new Creation</i>, as in a certain Respect
to lay aside the outward Knowledge of Christ, or the Knowledge of
him after the Flesh, in these Words, 2 <i>Cor.</i> v. 16, 17. <i>Wherefore henceforth
know we no Man after the Flesh; yea, though we have known Christ
after the Flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any
Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, old Things are passed away, behold
all Things are become new.</i> Whence it manifestly appears, that he
makes the Knowledge of Christ after the Flesh but as it were the
Rudiments which young Children learn, which after they are become
better Scholars, are of less Use to them; because they have
and possess the very Substance of those first Precepts in their Minds.
As all Comparisons halt in some Part, so shall I not affirm this to
hold in every Respect; yet so far will this hold, that as those that
go no farther than the Rudiments are never to be accounted learned,
and as they grow beyond these Things, so they have less Use of
them, even so such as go no farther than the outward Knowledge of
Christ shall never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. But such as come
to know this <i>new Birth</i>, to be in Christ indeed, to be a <i>new Creature</i>,
to have <i>Old Things passed away, and all Things become new</i>, may safely
say with the Apostle, <i>Though we have known Christ after the Flesh, yet now
henceforth know we him no more</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>But by the Work of Light and Grace in the Heart.</i></span>Now this <i>new Creature</i> proceeds from
the Work of this <i>Light</i> and <i>Grace</i> in the Heart: It is that Word
which we speak of, that is sharp and piercing, that <i>implanted Word</i>,
able to save the Soul, by which this Birth is begotten; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
Christ has purchased unto us this holy Seed, that thereby this Birth
might be brought forth <i>in</i> us, which is therefore also called <i>the Manifestation
of the Spirit, given to every one to profit withal</i>; for it is written,
that <i>by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body</i>. And the Apostle
<i>Peter</i> also ascribeth this Birth to the Seed and Word of God, which
we have so much declared of, saying, 1 <i>Pet.</i> i. 23. <i>Being born again,
not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth
and abideth for ever.</i> Though then this Seed be small in its Appearance,
so that Christ compares it to a <i>Grain of Mustard-seed, which is
the least of all Seeds</i>, Matth. xiii. 31, 32. and that it be hid in the
earthly Part of Man’s Heart; yet therein is Life and Salvation towards
the Sons of Men wrapped up, which comes to be revealed as
they give Way to it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Kingdom of God is in the </i>Seed<i>, in the Hearts of all Men.</i></span>And in this Seed in the Hearts of all Men
is the <i>Kingdom of God</i>, as in Capacity to be produced, or rather exhibited,
according as it receives Depth, is nourished, and not choked:
Hence Christ saith, that <i>The Kingdom of God was in the very Pharisees</i>,
Luke xvii. 20, 21. who did oppose and resist him, and were justly
accounted as <i>Serpents</i>, and a <i>Generation of Vipers</i>. Now the <i>Kingdom
of God</i> could be no otherwise in them than in a <i>Seed</i>, even as the
<i>Thirty-fold</i> and the <i>Hundred-fold</i> is wrapt up in a small Seed, lying in
a barren Ground, which springs not forth because it wants Nourishment:
And as the whole Body of a great Tree is wrapped up potentially
in the Seed of the Tree, and so is brought forth in due
Season; and as the Capacity of a Man or Woman is not only in a
Child, but even in the very <i>Embryo</i>, even so the <i>Kingdom of Jesus
Christ</i>, yea, <i>Jesus Christ </i>himself<i>, Christ within, who is the Hope of Glory</i>,
and becometh <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Righteousness</i>, <i>Sanctification</i> and <i>Redemption</i>, is
in every Man’s and Woman’s Heart, in that little <i>incorruptible Seed</i>,
ready to be brought forth, as it is cherished and received in the
Love of it. For there can be no Men worse than those rebellious
and unbelieving <i>Pharisees</i> were; and yet this <i>Kingdom</i> was thus <i>within
them</i>, and they were directed to look for it there: So it is neither
<i>lo here</i>, nor <i>lo there</i>, in this or the other Observation, that this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
known, but as this Seed of God in the Heart is minded and entertained.
And certainly hence it is, even because this Light, Seed,
and Grace that appears in the Heart of Man is so little regarded,
and so much overlooked, that so few know Christ brought forth in
them.
<span class="sidenote">Calvinists, Papists, Arminians<i> and </i>Socinians<i> Errors denying the Light to be saving.</i></span>The one Sort, to wit, the <i>Calvinists</i>, they look upon Grace
as an irresistible Power, and therefore neglect and despise this eternal
Seed of the Kingdom in their Hearts, as a low, insufficient, useless
Thing as to their Salvation. On the other Hand, the <i>Papists</i>, <i>Arminians</i>,
and <i>Socinians</i>, they go about to set up their natural Power and
Will with one Consent, denying that this little Seed, this small
Appearance of the Light, is that supernatural saving Grace of God
given to every Man to save him. And so upon them is verified that
Saying of the Lord Jesus Christ, <i>This is the Condemnation of the World,
that Light is come into the World, but Men love Darkness rather than
Light</i>; the Reason is added, <i>Because their Deeds are evil</i>. All confess
they feel this; but they will not have it to be of that Virtue.
Some will have it to be <i>Reason</i>; some a <i>natural Conscience</i>; some,
<i>certain Reliques of God’s Image, that remained in</i> Adam. So that Christ,
as he met with Opposition from all Kinds of Professors in his outward
Appearance, doth now also in his inward.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Meanness of Christ’s Appearance in the Flesh.</i></span>It was the Meanness of
his outward Man that made many despise him, saying, <i>Is not this the
Son of the Carpenter? Are not his Brethren and Sisters among us? Is not this a
</i>Galilean<i>? And came there ever a Prophet out of </i>Galilee? And such-like
Reasonings. For they expected an outward Deliverer, who as a Prince
should deliver them with great Ease from their Enemies, and not such
a <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> as should be crucified shamefully, and as it were lead
them into many Sorrows, Troubles, and Afflictions. So the Meanness
of this Appearance makes the crafty <i>Jesuits</i>, the pretended rational
Socinians, and the learned <i>Arminians</i>, overlook it; desiring rather something
that they might exercise their Subtilty, Reason, and Learning
about, and use the Liberty of their own Wills. And the secure
<i>Calvinists</i>, they would have a Christ to save them without any
Trouble; to destroy all their Enemies for them without them, and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
or little within, and in the mean While to be at Ease to live
in their Sins secure.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Nature of the Light.</i></span>Whence, when all is well examined, the
Cause is plain; it is <i>Because their Deeds are Evil</i>, that with one Consent
they reject this <i>Light</i>: For it checks the wisest of them all, and
the learnedest of them all; in Secret it reproves them; neither can
all their <i>Logick</i> silence it, nor can the securest among them stop its
Voice from crying, and reproving them within, for all their Confidence
in the outward Knowledge of Christ, or of what he hath suffered
outwardly for them. For, as hath been often said, <i>In a Day
it strives with all, wrestles with all</i>; and it is the unmortified Nature,
the first Nature, the old <i>Adam</i>, yet alive in the wisest, in the learnedest,
in the most zealous for the outward Knowledge of Christ,
that denies this, that despises it, that shuts it out, to their own Condemnation.
They come all under this Description, <i>Every one that
doeth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should
be reproved</i>, John iii. 20. So that it may be said, now, and we can
say from a true and certain Experience, as it was of old, <i>Psalm</i>
cxviii. 22. <i>Mat.</i> xxi. 42. <i>Mark</i> xii. 10. <i>Luke</i> xx. 17. <i>Acts</i> iv. 11. <i>The
Stone which the Builders</i> of all Kinds <i>have rejected, the same is become unto us
the Head of the Corner.</i> Glory to God for ever! who hath chosen us
as First-fruits to himself in this Day, wherein he is arisen to plead
with the Nations; and therefore hath sent us forth to preach this
everlasting Gospel unto all, Christ nigh to all, the Light in all,
the Seed sown in the Hearts of all, that Men may come and apply
their Minds to it. And we rejoice that we have been made to
lay down our Wisdom and Learning (such of us as have had some
of it) and our carnal Reasoning, to learn of Jesus; and sit down at
the Feet of Jesus in our Hearts, and hear him, who there makes all
Things manifest, and reproves all Things by his Light, <i>Ephes.</i> v. 13.
For many are wise and learned in the Notion, in the Letter of the
Scripture,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Wise and Learned in the Notion, Crucifiers of Christ.</i></span>as the <i>Pharisees</i> were, and can speak much of Christ, and
plead strongly against <i>Infidels</i>, <i>Turks</i>, and <i>Jews</i>, and it may be also
against some <i>Heresies</i>, who, in the mean Time, are crucifying Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
in the small Appearance of his Seed in their Hearts. Oh! better were
it to be stripped and naked of all, to account it as Dross and Dung,
and become a Fool for Christ’s Sake, thus knowing him to teach thee
in thy Heart, so as thou mayest witness him raised there, feel the
Virtue of his Cross there, and say with the Apostle, <i>I glory in nothing,
save in the Cross of Christ, whereby I am crucified to the World, and
the World unto me</i>. This is better than to write thousands of Commentaries,
and to preach many Sermons. And it is thus to preach
Christ, and direct People to his pure Light in the Heart, that God
hath raised us up, and for which the wise Men of this World account
us Fools;
<span class="sidenote"><i>None are saved by the Knowledge of the History, but by the Operation of the Light of Christ in the Mystery.</i></span>because by the Operation of this Cross of Christ in
our Hearts, we have denied our own Wisdom and Wills in many
Things, and have forsaken the vain Worships, Fashions, and Customs
of this World. For these divers Centuries the World hath
been full of a dry, fruitless, and barren Knowledge of Christ, feeding
upon the Husk, and neglecting the Kernel; following after the
Shadow, but Strangers to the Substance. Hence the Devil matters
not how much of that Knowledge abounds, provided he can but
possess the Heart, and rule in the Will, crucify the Appearance of
Christ there, and so keep the Seed of the Kingdom from taking Root.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Contentions about outward Observations and Lo here’s.</i></span>For he has led them abroad, <i>lo here</i>, and <i>lo there</i>, and has made
them wrestle in a false Zeal so much one against another, contending
for this outward Observation, and for the other outward
Observation, seeking <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in this and the other external Thing,
as in <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>; contending one with another how he is
there, while some will have him to be present therein this Way,
and some the other Way; and some in Scriptures, in Books, in Societies,
and Pilgrimages, and Merits. But some, confiding in an
external barren Faith, think all is well, if they do but firmly believe
that he died for their Sins past, present, and to come; while
in the mean Time Christ lies crucified and slain, and is daily resisted
and gainsayed in his Appearance in their Hearts.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Call of God to blinded Christendom.</i></span>Thus, from
a Sense of this Blindness and Ignorance that is come over Christendom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
it is that we are led and moved of the Lord so constantly
and frequently to call all, invite all, intreat all, to turn to the
Light in them, to mind the Light in them, to believe in Christ, as
he is in them: And that in the Name, Power, and Authority of the
Lord, not in School-arguments and Distinctions (for which many
of the wise Men of this World account us Fools and Mad-men) we
do charge and command them to lay aside their Wisdom, to come
down out of that proud, airy, Brain-knowledge, and to stop that
Mouth, how eloquent soever to the worldly Ear it may appear, and
to be silent, and sit down as in the Dust, and to mind the Light of
Christ in their own Consciences; which, if minded, they would
find as a <i>sharp two-edged Sword</i> in their Hearts, and as a <i>Fire</i> and a
<i>Hammer</i>, that would knock against and burn up all that carnal,
gathered, natural Stuff, and make the stoutest of them all tremble,
and become <i>Quakers</i> indeed: Which those that come not to feel
now, and kiss not the Son while the Day lasteth, but harden their
Hearts, will feel to be a certain Truth when it is too late. To conclude,
as saith the Apostle, <i>All ought to examine themselves, whether they
be in the Faith indeed; and try their ownselves: For except Jesus Christ be in
them, they are certainly Reprobates</i>, 2 Cor. xiii. 5.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">2 Part.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>That many by the Light may be saved, that have not the outward Knowledge of Christ.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, That which remains now to be proved, is, <i>That
by the Operation of this Light and Seed, some have been, and may yet be saved,
to whom the Gospel is not outwardly preached, nor the History of Christ outwardly
known</i>. To make this the easier, we have already shewn how that
Christ hath died for all Men; and consequently these are enlightened
by Christ, and have a Measure of saving Light and Grace; yea,
that the Gospel, though not in any outward Dispensation, is preached
to them, and in them: So that thereby they are stated in a Possibility
of Salvation. From which I may thus argue:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>To whom the Gospel, the Power of God unto Salvation, is
manifest, they may be saved, whatever outward Knowledge they
want:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>But this Gospel is preached <i>in every Creature</i>; in which is certainly
comprehended many that have not the outward Knowledge:</p>

<p>Therefore of those many may be saved.</p>

<p>But to those Arguments, by which it hath been proved, <i>That all
Men have a Measure of saving Grace</i>, I shall add one, and that very
observable, not yet mentioned, <i>viz.</i> that excellent Saying of the
Apostle <i>Paul</i> to <i>Titus</i>, Chap. ii. Ver. 11. <i>The Grace of God, that brings
Salvation, hath appeared to all Men; teaching us, That denying Ungodliness
and worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
World</i>: Than which there can be nothing more clear, it comprehending
both the Parts of the Controversy. <i>First</i>, It testifies that it
is no natural Principle or Light, but saith plainly, <i>It brings Salvation</i>.
<i>Secondly</i>, It says not, that it hath appeared to a <i>few</i>, but <i>unto all Men</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The saving Grace of God teacheth the whole Duty of Man.</i></span>The Fruit of it declares also how efficacious it is, seeing it comprehends
the whole Duty of Man: It both teacheth us, first, to forsake
Evil, to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts; and then it teacheth
us our whole Duty. <i>First</i>, to live <i>Soberly</i>; that comprehends Temperance,
Chastity, Meekness, and those Things that relate unto a
Man’s self. <i>Secondly</i>, <i>Righteously</i>; that comprehends Equity, Justice,
and Honesty, and those Things which relate to our Neighbours.
And lastly, <i>Godly</i>; which comprehends Piety, Faithfulness, and Devotion,
which are the Duties relating to God. So then there is
nothing required of Man, or is needful to Man, which this Grace
teacheth not. Yet I have heard a public Preacher (one of those
that are accounted zealous Men) to evade the Strength of this Text,
deny this Grace to be saving, and say, <i>It was only intended of common
Favours and Graces, such as is the Heat of the Fire, and outward Light of
the Sun</i>. Such is the Darkness and Ignorance of those that oppose
the Truth; whereas the Text saith expresly, that it is <i>saving</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Absurdities of our Adversaries Comment upon the Word </i>All<i>, denying Grace to be saving.</i> Tit. 2. 11.</span>Others,
that cannot deny but it is saving, alledge, This [<i>All</i>] comprehends
not every Individual, but only all Kinds: But is a bare Negation
sufficient to overturn the Strength of a positive Assertion? If the
Scriptures may be so abused, what so absurd, as may not be pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
for from them? Or what so manifest, as may not be denied? But
we have no Reason to be staggered by their denying, so long as
our Faith is found in express Terms of Scripture; they may as
well seek to persuade us, that we do not intend that which we affirm
(though we know the Contrary) as make us believe, that when
the Apostle speaks forth our Doctrine in plain Words, yet he intends
theirs, which is quite the Contrary. And indeed, can there be any
Thing more absurd, than to say, where the Word is plainly [<i>All</i>]
<i>Few</i> is only intended? For they will not have [<i>All</i>] taken here for
the <i>greater Number</i>. Indeed, as the Case may be sometimes, by a
Figure [<i>All</i>] may be taken, of two Numbers, for the greater Number;
but let them shew us, if they can, either in Scripture, or profane
or ecclesiastical Writings, that any Man that wrote Sense did
ever use the Word [<i>All</i>] to express, of two Numbers, the lesser.
Whereas they affirm, that the far lesser Number have received saving
Grace; and yet will they have the Apostle, by [<i>All</i>] to have signified
so. Though this might suffice, yet, to put it further beyond
all Question, I shall instance another Saying of the same Apostle, that
we may use him as his own Commentator, <i>Rom.</i> v. 18. <i>Therefore as
by the Offence of One, Judgment come upon all Men to Condemnation, even
so by the Righteousness of One, the Free-gift came upon all Men unto Justification
of Life.</i> Here no Man of Reason, except he will be obstinately
ignorant, will deny, but this similitive Particle [<i>As</i>] makes
the [<i>All</i>] which goes before, and comes after, to be of one and the
same Extent; or else let them shew one Example, either in Scripture,
or elsewhere, among Men that speak proper Language, where
it is otherwise. We must then either affirm that this Loss, which
leads to Condemnation, hath not come upon <i>all</i>; or say, that this
free Gift is come upon <i>all</i> by Christ. Whence I thus argue:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>If all Men have received a Loss from <i>Adam</i>, which leads to Condemnation;
then all Men have received a Gift from <i>Christ</i>, which
leads to Justification:</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Even the </i>Heathens<i> may be saved by the Light.</i></span>From all which it naturally follows, that all Men, even the <i>Heathens</i>,
may be saved: For <i>Christ</i> was given as a <i>Light to enlighten the Gentiles</i>,
<i>Isa.</i> xlix. 6. Now, to say that though they might have been
saved, yet none were, is to judge too uncharitably. I see not what
Reason can be alleged for it; yea, though it were granted, which
never can be, that none of the <i>Heathens</i> were saved; it will not
from thence follow, That they could not have been saved; or that
none now in their Condition can be saved. For, <i>A non esse ad non
posse non datur sequela</i>, <i>i. e.</i> That Consequence is false, that concludes
a Thing cannot be, because it is not.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj.</span>But if it be objected, which is the great Objection, <i>That there is
no Name under Heaven, by which Salvation is known, but by the Name</i>
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>:</p>

<p><i>Therefore they (not knowing this) cannot be saved.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; Though they know it not outwardly, yet if they know
it inwardly, by feeling the Virtues and Power of it, the Name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
indeed, which signifies a <i>Saviour</i>, to free them from Sin and Iniquity
in their Hearts, they are saved by it:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The literal Knowledge of Christ is not saving; but the real experimental.</i></span>I confess there is no other
Name to be saved by: But Salvation lieth not in the literal, but in
the experimental Knowledge; albeit those that have the literal
Knowledge are not saved by it, without this real experimental Knowledge:
Yet those that have the real Knowledge may be saved without
the external; as by the Arguments hereafter brought will more
appear. For if the outward distinct Knowledge of him, by whose
Means I receive Benefit, were necessary for me before I could reap
any Fruit of it; then, by the Rule of <i>Contraries</i>, it would follow, that
I could receive no Hurt, without I had also the distinct Knowledge
of him that occasioned it; whereas Experience proves the Contrary.
How many are injured by <i>Adam</i>’s Fall, that know nothing of there
ever being such a Man in the World, or of his eating the forbidden
Fruit? Why may they not then be saved by the Gift and Grace of <i>Christ</i>
in them, making them righteous and holy, though they know not
distinctly how that was purchased unto them by the Death and Sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
of <i>Jesus</i> that was crucified at <i>Jerusalem</i>; especially seeing God
hath made that Knowledge simply impossible to them? As many
Men are killed by Poison infused into their Meat, though they neither
know what the Poison was, nor who infused it; so also on the
other Hand, how many are cured of their Diseases by good Remedies,
who know not how the Medicine is prepared, what the Ingredients
are, nor oftentimes who made it? The like may also hold
in spiritual Things, as we shall hereafter prove.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The outward Knowledge not essential to Salvation: Instance in Infants and deaf Persons.</i></span><i>First</i>, If there were such an absolute Necessity for this
outward Knowledge, that it were even of the Essentials of Salvation,
then none could be saved without it; whereas our Adversaries deny
not, but readily confess, that many Infants and deaf Persons are
saved without it: So that here they break that general Rule, and
make Salvation possible without it. Neither can they allege, that
it is because such are free from Sin; seeing they also affirm, that all
Infants, because of <i>Adam</i>’s Sin, deserve eternal Condemnation, as
being really guilty in the Sight of God; and of deaf People, it is
not to be doubted, and Experience shews us, that they are subject
to many common Iniquities, as well as other Men.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>If it be said, <i>That these Children are the Children of believing Parents</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>What then? They will not say that they transmit Grace to their
Children. Do they not affirm, That the Children of believing
Parents are guilty of original Sin, and deserve Death as well as
others? How prove they that that makes up the Loss of all explicit
Knowledge?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>If they say, <i>Deaf People may be made sensible of the Gospel by Signs</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>All the Signs cannot give them any explicit Knowledge of the
History of the Death, Sufferings, and Resurrection of Christ. For
what Signs can inform a deaf Man, <i>That the Son of God took on him
Man’s Nature, was born of a Virgin, and suffered under</i> Pontius Pilate?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span>And if they should further allege, <i>That they are within the Bosom of
the visible Church, and Partakers of the Sacraments</i>:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>All that gives no Certainty of Salvation; for, as the <i>Protestants</i> confess,
they confer not Grace <i>ex opere operato</i>. And will they not acknowledge,
that many are in the Bosom of the Church, who are
visibly no Members of it? But if this Charity be extended towards
such who are where the Gospel is preached, so that they may be
judged capable of Salvation, because they are under a simple Impossibility
of distinctly knowing the Means of Salvation; what Reason
can be alleged why the like Charity may not be had to such,
as though they can hear, yet are under a simple Impossibility of
hearing, because it is not spoken unto them?
<span class="sidenote"><i>A </i>Chinese<i> or </i>Indian<i> excusable for not knowing the History of the Death of Christ</i>, &amp;c.</span>Is not a Man in <i>China</i>,
or in <i>India</i>, as much to be excused for not knowing a Thing which
he never heard of, as a deaf Man here, who cannot hear? For as
the deaf Man is not to be blamed, because God hath been pleased to
suffer him to lie under this Infirmity; so is the <i>Chinese</i> or the <i>Indian</i>
as excusable, because God hath with-held from him the Opportunity
of hearing. He that cannot hear a Thing, as being necessarily absent,
and he that cannot hear it, as being naturally deaf, are to be
placed in the same Category.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This manifestly appears by that Saying of <i>Peter</i>, Acts x. 34.
<i>Of a Truth I perceive that God is no Respecter of Persons; but in every Nation,
he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him</i>. <i>Peter</i>
was before liable to that Mistake that the rest of the <i>Jews</i> were in;
judging that all were unclean, except themselves, and that no Man
could be saved, except they were proselyted to their Religion, and
circumcised. But God shewed <i>Peter</i> otherwise in a Vision, and
taught him to call nothing <i>common</i> or <i>unclean</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>God regarded the Prayers of </i>Cornelius<i>, a Stranger to the Law.</i></span>and therefore, seeing
that God regarded the Prayers of <i>Cornelius</i>, who was a Stranger to the
Law, and to Jesus Christ as to the outward, yet <i>Peter</i> saw that God
had accepted him; and he is said to <i>fear God</i> before he had this
outward Knowledge: Therefore <i>Peter</i> concludes that every one in
every Nation, without respect of Persons, that feareth God and
worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him. So he makes the Fear
of God and the working of Righteousness, and not an outward historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
Knowledge, the <i>Qualification</i>: They then that have this, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: where-ever">wherever</span>
they be, they are saved. Now we have already proved, that
to every Man that Grace is given, whereby he may live godlily and
righteously; and we see, that by this Grace <i>Cornelius</i> did so, and
was accepted, and his Prayers came up for a Memorial before God
before he had this outward Knowledge.
<span class="sidenote"><i>From what Scripture did </i>Job<i> learn his excellent Knowledge?</i></span>Also, Was not <i>Job a perfect
and upright Man, that feared God, and eschewed Evil</i>? Who taught <i>Job</i>
this? How knew <i>Job Adam</i>’s Fall? And from what Scripture learned
he that excellent Knowledge he had, and that Faith, by which he
knew his <i>Redeemer lived</i>? (For many make him as old as <i>Moses</i>). Was
not this by an inward Grace in the Heart? Was it not that inward
Grace that taught <i>Job</i> to eschew Evil, and to fear God? And
was it not by the Workings thereof that he became a just and upright
Man? How doth he reprove the Wickedness of Men, <i>Chap.</i> xxiv?
And after he hath numbered up their Wickedness, doth he not
condemn them, <i>Ver. 13.</i> for <i>rebelling</i> against this <i>Light</i>, for not knowing
the Way thereof, nor abiding in the Paths thereof? It appears
then <i>Job</i> believed that Men had a Light, and that because they rebelled
against it, therefore they knew not its Ways, and abode not
in its Paths; even as the <i>Pharisees</i>, who had the Scriptures, are said
to <i>err</i>, not knowing the Scriptures.
<span class="sidenote">Job<i>’s Friends; their excellent Sayings.</i></span>And also <i>Job</i>’s Friends, though
in some Things wrong; yet who taught them all those excellent
Sayings and Knowledge which they had? Did not God give it them,
in order to save them? or was it merely to condemn them? Who
taught <i>Elihu</i>, That <i>the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth Understanding</i>;
<i>that the Spirit of God made him</i>, <i>and the Breath of the Almighty gave him
Life</i>? And did not the Lord accept a Sacrifice for them? And who
dare say that they are damned? But further, the Apostle puts this
Controversy out of Doubt; for, if we may believe his plain Assertions,
he tells us, <i>Rom.</i> ii. <i>That the </i>Heathens<i> did the Things contained
in the Law.</i> From whence I thus argue;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>In every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh Righteousness,
is accepted:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>But many of the <i>Heathens</i> feared God, and wrought Righteousness:</p>

<p>Therefore they were accepted.</p>

<p>The <i>Minor</i> is proved from the Example of <i>Cornelius</i>: But I shall
further prove it thus;</p>

<p>He that doth the Things contained in the Law, feareth God, and
worketh Righteousness:</p>

<p>But the <i>Heathens</i> did the Things contained in the Law:</p>

<p>Therefore they feared God, and wrought Righteousness.</p>

<p>Can there be any Thing more clear? For if to do the Things
contained in the Law, be not to fear God, and work Righteousness,
then what can be said to do so, seeing the Apostle calls the Law
<i>Spiritual</i>, <i>Holy</i>, <i>Just</i>, and <i>Good</i>? But this appears manifestly by another
<i>Medium</i>, taken out of the same Chapter, <i>Ver.</i> 13. So that nothing
can be more clear: The Words are, <i>The Doers of the Law shall
be justified</i>. From which I thus argue, without adding any Word of
my own;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>The Doers of the Law shall be justified:</p>

<p>But the <i>Gentiles</i> do the Things contained in the Law:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Gentiles<i> justified doing the Law.</i></span>All that know but a Conclusion, do easily see what follows from these
express Words of the Apostle. And indeed, he through that whole
Chapter labours, as if he were contending now with our Adversaries,
to confirm this Doctrine, Ver. 9, 10, 11. <i>Tribulation and Anguish
upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil, to the </i>Jew<i> first, and also to the
Gentile: For there is no Respect of Persons with God.</i> Where the <i>Apostle</i>
clearly <i>homologates</i>, or confesses to the Sentence of <i>Peter</i> before-mentioned;
and shews that <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i>, or as he himself explains in
the following <i>Verses</i>, both they that have an outward Law and they
that have none, when they <i>do Good</i> shall be <i>justified</i>. And to put us
out of all Doubt, in the very following Verses he tells, That <i>the
Doers of the Law are justified</i>; and that the <i>Gentiles did the Law</i>. So
that except we think he spake not what he intended, we may safely
conclude, that such <i>Gentiles</i> were justified, and did partake of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
Honour, Glory, and Peace, which comes upon every one that doth
Good; even the <i>Gentiles</i>, that are without the Law, when they <i>work
Good</i>; seeing with God there is no <i>Respect of Persons</i>. So as we see,
that it is not the having the outward Knowledge that doth save, without
the inward; so neither doth the Want of it, to such to whom
God hath made it impossible, who have the inward, bring Condemnation.
And many that have wanted the Outward, have had
a Knowledge of this inwardly, by Virtue of that inward Grace and
Light given to every Man, working in them, by which they forsook
Iniquity, and became just and holy, as is above proved;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Many wanting the History, were sensible of the Loss by </i>Adam<i>, and Salvation come by Christ in themselves.</i></span>who,
though they knew not the History of <i>Adam</i>’s Fall, yet were sensible
in themselves of the Loss that came by it, feeling their Inclinations
to sin, and the Body of Sin in them: And though they knew not
the Coming of Christ, yet were sensible of that inward Power and
Salvation which came by him, even before as well as since his Appearance
in the Flesh. For I question whether these Men can prove,
that all the <i>Patriarchs</i> and <i>Fathers</i> before <i>Moses</i> had a distinct Knowledge
either of the one or the other, or that they knew the History
of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and of <i>Adam</i>’s eating
the forbidden Fruit; far less that Christ should be born of a Virgin,
should be crucified, and treated in the Manner he was. For it is
justly to be believed, that what <i>Moses</i> wrote of <i>Adam</i>, and of the first
Times, was not by Tradition, but by Revelation;
<span class="sidenote"><i>How little the </i>Jews<i> knew Christ, mistaking the Prophets.</i></span>yea, we see that
not only after the Writing of <i>Moses</i>, but even of <i>David</i> and all the
<i>Prophets</i>, who prophesied so much of Christ, how little the <i>Jews</i>, that
were expecting and wishing for the <i>Messiah</i>, could thereby discern
him when he came, that they crucified him as a <i>Blasphemer</i>, not as a
<i>Messiah</i>, by mistaking the Prophecies concerning him; for <i>Peter</i> saith
expresly, <i>Acts</i> iii. 17. to the <i>Jews</i>, <i>That both they and their Rulers did it
through Ignorance</i>. And <i>Paul</i> saith, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. 8. <i>That had they known it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</i> Yea, <i>Mary</i> herself, to
whom the Angel had spoken, and who had laid up all the miraculous
Things accompanying his Birth in her Heart, she did not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
how, when <i>he disputed with the Doctors in the Temple, that he
was about his Father’s Business</i>. And the Apostles that had believed
him, conversed daily with him, and saw his Miracles, could not
understand, neither believe those Things which related to his <i>Death</i>,
<i>Sufferings</i>, and <i>Resurrection</i>, but were in a certain Respect stumbled
at them.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVII.</h3> So we see how that it is the inward Work, and not the
outward History and Scripture, that gives the true Knowledge;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Heathens<i> were sensible of the Loss received by </i>Adam.</span>and
by this inward <i>Light</i> many of the <i>Heathen Philosophers</i> were sensible of
the Loss received by <i>Adam</i>, though they knew not the outward
History: Hence <i>Plato</i> asserted, That <i>Man’s Soul was fallen into a dark
Cave, where it only conversed with Shadows</i>. <i>Pythagoras</i> saith, <i>Man wandereth
in this World as a Stranger, banished from the Presence of God</i>. And
<i>Plotinus</i> compareth <i>Man’s Soul, fallen from God, to a Cinder, or dead Coal,
out of which the Fire is extinguished</i>. <span class="sidenote">Heathen-Philosophers
<i>Divine Knowledge</i>. Plato. Pythag. Plotin.</span>Some of them said, That <i>the Wings
of the Soul were clipped or fallen off, so that it could not flee unto God</i>. All
which, and many more such Expressions, that might be gathered out
of their Writings, shew, that they were not without a Sense of this
Loss. Also they had a Knowledge and Discovery of Jesus Christ inwardly,
as a Remedy <i>in</i> them, to deliver them from that evil Seed,
and the evil Inclinations of their own Hearts, though not under that
particular Denomination.</div>

<p>Some called him an <i>Holy Spirit</i>, as <i>Seneca</i>, Epist. 41. who said, <i>There
is an holy Spirit in us, that treateth us as we treat him.</i>
<span class="sidenote">Cicero<i> calls it an Innate Light. </i>Lactan.<i> In Sect.</i></span><i>Cicero</i> calleth it
an <i>innate Light</i>, in his Book <i>De Republica</i>, cited by <i>Lactantius</i>, 6 <i>Instit.</i>
where he calls this <i>Right Reason, given unto all, constant and eternal, calling
unto Duty by commanding, and deterring from Deceit by forbidding</i>. Adding,
<i>That it cannot be abrogated, neither can any be freed from it, neither
by Senate or People; that it is one, eternal, and the same always to all Nations;
so that there is not one at </i>Rome<i>, and another at </i>Athens<i>: Whoso obeys it not,
must flee from himself, and in this is greatly tormented, although he should
escape all other Punishments</i>. <i>Plotinus</i> also calls him <i>Light</i>, saying, That
<i>as the Sun cannot be known but by its own Light, so God cannot be known but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
with his own Light: And as the Eye cannot see the Sun but by receiving its
Image, so Man cannot know God but by receiving his Image; and that it behoveth
Man to come to Purity of Heart before he could know God</i>; calling
him also <i>Wisdom</i>, a name frequently given him in Scripture; see
<i>Prov.</i> i. 20. to the End; and <i>Prov.</i> viii. 9, 34. where <i>Wisdom</i> is said to
cry, intreat, and invite all to come unto her, and learn of her: And
what is this <i>Wisdom</i> but Christ? Hence such as came among the
<i>Heathen</i>, to forsake Evil and cleave to Righteousness, were called
<i>Philosophers</i>, that is, Lovers of <i>Wisdom</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Philosophers<i> whence so called?</i></span>They knew this <i>Wisdom</i> was nigh
unto them, and that <i>The best Knowledge of God, and divine Mysteries, was
by the Inspiration of the Wisdom of God</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Phocylides.</span><i>Phocylides</i> affirmed, That <i>the
Word of the Wisdom of God was best</i>. His Words in the Greek are, [Greek: Tês
de Theopneustou sophias logos estin aristos: Της δε Θεοπνευσςου σοφιας λογος εστιν αριστος].</p>

<p>And much more of this Kind might be instanced, by which it
appears they knew Christ; and by his working <i>in</i> them, were brought
from Unrighteousness to Righteousness, and to love that Power by
which they felt themselves redeemed; so that, as saith the Apostle, <i>They
shew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, and did the Things contained
in the Law</i>; and therefore, as <i>all Doers of the Law are, were no Doubt justified</i>,
and saved thus by the Power of Christ <i>in</i> them. And as this was the
Judgment of the Apostle, so was it of the primitive Christians.
<span class="sidenote">Socrates <i>a Christian</i>, &amp;c.</span>Hence
<i>Justin Martyr</i> stuck not to call <i>Socrates a Christian</i>, saying, That <i>all such
as lived according to the divine Word in them, which was in all Men, were
Christians</i>, <i>such as</i> Socrates <i>and</i> Heraclitus, and others among the
Greeks, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>That such as live with the Word, are Christians without Fear or
Anxiety.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Clem. Alex.</span><i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i> saith, <i>Apol. 2. Strom. Lib. 1</i>. That<i> this Wisdom or
Philosophy was necessary to the </i>Gentiles<i>, and was their </i>School-master<i> to
lead them unto Christ, by which of old the Greeks were justified.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Augustin.<i> de Civ. Dei.</i></span><i>Nor do I think</i>, saith <i>Augustine</i>, in his Book of the <i>City of God</i>,
Lib. 18. Cap. 47. <i>that the </i>Jews<i> dare affirm that none belonged unto God
but the</i> Israelites.
<span class="sidenote">Lud. Vives.</span>Upon which Place <i>Ludovicus Vives</i> saith, That <i>thus
the </i>Gentiles<i>, not having a Law, were a Law unto themselves; and the Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
of so living is the Gift of God, and proceeds from the Son; of whom it is
written, that he</i> enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Platonists<i> saw the Word in the Beginning; which was Light.</i></span><i>Augustine</i> also testifies in his Confessions, <i>Lib. 1. Cap. 9</i>. That <i>he
had read in the Writings of the </i>Platonists<i>, though not in the very same Words,
yet that which by many and multiplied Reasons did persuade, that in the Beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God; this was in the Beginning
with God, by which all Things were made, and without which nothing was
made that was made: In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men:
And the Light shined in the Darkness, and the Darkness did not comprehend
it. And albeit the Soul gives Testimony concerning the Light, yet it is not
the </i>Light<i>, but the </i>Word of God<i>; for <span class="smcap">God</span> is the true <span class="smcap">Light</span>, which
enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World</i>; and so repeats to
Ver. 14. of <i>John</i> i. adding, <i>These Things have I there read</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hai Eben Yokdan.</span>Yea, there is a Book translated out of the <i>Arabick</i>, which gives an
Account of one <i>Hai Eben Yokdan</i>; who living in an Island alone, without
Converse of Man, attained to such a profound Knowledge of
God, as to have immediate Converse with him, and to affirm, <i>That
the best and most certain Knowledge of God is not that which is attained by
Premises premised, and Conclusions deduced</i>; <span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Supreme
Intellect<i> enjoyed by the Mind of Men.</i></span><i>but that which is enjoyed by Conjunction
of the Mind of Man with the Supreme Intellect, after the Mind is

gathered into a profound Stillness</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVIII.</h3> Seeing then it is by this inward Gift, Grace, and
Light, that both those that have the Gospel preached unto them,
come to have Jesus brought forth <i>in</i> them, and to have the saving
and sanctified Use of all outward Helps and Advantages; and also
by this same Light that all may come to be saved; and that God
calls, invites, and strives with all, in a Day, and saveth many, to
whom he hath not seen meet to convey this outward Knowledge;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Day of the Lord proclaimed.</i></span>therefore we, having the Experience of the inward and powerful
Work of this Light in our Hearts, even <i>Jesus</i> revealed <i>in</i> us, cannot
cease to proclaim the Day of the Lord that is arisen in it, crying out
with the Woman of <i>Samaria</i>; <i>Come and see one that hath told me all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
ever I have done; Is not this the Christ?</i> That others may come and
feel the same <i>in</i> themselves, and may know, that that little small
Thing that reproves them in their Hearts, however they have despised
and neglected it, is nothing less than the Gospel preached <i>in</i>
them; <i>Christ</i>, the <i>Wisdom</i> and <i>Power of God</i>, being <i>in</i> and <i>by</i> that Seed
seeking to save their Souls.</div>

<p>Of this <i>Light</i> therefore <i>Augustine</i> speaks in his <i>Confessions</i>, Lib. 11.
Cap. 9. <i>In this Beginning, O God! thou madest the Heavens and the
Earth, in thy Word, in thy Son, in thy Virtue, in thy Wisdom, wonderfully saying,
and wonderfully doing. Who shall comprehend it? Who shall declare it</i>?
<span class="sidenote">Augustine <i>trembled at the In-shinings of the Light unto him, and why</i>?</span><i>What is that which shineth in unto me, and smites my Heart without Hurt, at
which I both tremble, and am inflamed? I tremble, in so far as I am unlike
unto it; and I am inflamed in so far as I am like unto it: It is Wisdom,
Wisdom which shineth in unto me, and dispelleth my Cloud, which had again
covered me, after I was departed from it, with Darkness and the Heap of
my Punishments.</i> And again he saith, Lib. 10. Cap. 27. <i>It is too late
that I have loved thee, O thou Beautifulness, so ancient and so new! Late have
I loved thee, and behold thou wast within, and I was without, and there was
seeking thee! Thou didst call, thou didst cry, thou didst break my Deafness,
thou glancedst, thou didst shine, thou chasedst away my Darkness.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Buchanan<i> testifying to the Light.</i></span>Of this also our Countryman <i>George Buchanan</i> speaketh thus in his
Book <i>De Jure regni apud Scotos</i>: <i>Truly I understand no other Thing at
present than that </i>Light<i> which is divinely infused into our Souls: For when
God formed Man, he not only gave him Eyes to his Body, by which he might
shun those Things that are hurtful to him, and follow those Things that are
profitable; but also hath set before his Mind as it were a certain Light, by which
he may discern Things that are vile from Things that are honest. Some call
this Power </i>Nature<i>, others the </i>Law of Nature<i>; I truly judge it to be divine,
and am persuaded that Nature and Wisdom never say different Things. Moreover
God hath given us a Compend of the Law, which in few Words comprehends
the Whole; to wit, that we should love him from our Hearts, and our
Neighbours as ourselves. And of this Law all the Books of the holy Scriptures,
which pertain to the forming of Manners, contain no other but an Explication.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Jew<i> and </i>Gentile, Scythian<i> and </i>Barbarian<i>, Partakers of the Salvation of Christ.</i></span>This is that universal evangelical Principle, in and by which this
Salvation of Christ is exhibited to <i>all</i> Men, both <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i>,
<i>Scythian</i> and <i>Barbarian</i>, of whatsoever Country or Kindred he be: And
therefore God hath raised up unto himself, in this our Age, faithful

<p class="chapter-head"><i>As many as resist not this </i>Light<i>, but receive the same, it becomes in
them an holy, pure, and spiritual Birth, bringing forth Holiness,
Righteousness, Purity, and all those other blessed Fruits which are
acceptable to </i>God<i>: By which holy Birth, to wit, </i>Jesus Christ
formed within us<i>, and working his Works in us, as we are
sanctified, so are we justified in the Sight of God, according to
the Apostle’s Words; </i>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus,
and by the Spirit of our God, 1<i> Cor. </i>vi. 11.<i> Therefore it is

us, by the Washing of Regeneration, and the Renewing
of the Holy Ghost, <i>Tit.</i> iii. 5.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> The <i>Doctrine of Justification</i> comes well in Order after the
discussing of the Extent of Christ’s Death, and of the
Grace thereby communicated, some of the sharpest Contests concerning
this having from thence their Rise. Many are the Disputes
among those called <i>Christians</i> concerning this Point; and indeed,
if all were truly minding that which justifieth, there would
be less Noise about the <i>Notions of Justification</i>. I shall briefly review
this Controversy as it stands among others, and as I have often seriously
observed it; then in short state the Controversy as to us, and
open our Sense and Judgment of it; and <i>lastly</i> prove it, if the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
will, by some Scripture Testimonies, and the certain Experience
of all that ever were truly justified.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Observat. <i>The Method of Justification taken by the Church of</i> Rome.</span>That this <i>Doctrine of Justification</i>, hath been and is greatly
vitiated in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, is not by us questioned; though our
Adversaries, who for want of better Arguments do often make Lies
their Refuge, have not spared in this Respect to stigmatize us with
Popery, but how untruly will hereafter appear. For to speak little of
their <i>Meritum ex condigno</i>, which was no Doubt a very common Doctrine
of the <i>Romish Church</i>, especially before <i>Luther</i>, though most of
their modern Writers, especially in their Controversies with Protestants,
do partly deny it, partly qualify it, and seem to state the
Matter only as if they were Propagators and Pleaders for good
Works by the others denied; yet if we look to the Effects of this
Doctrine among them, as they appear in the Generality of their
Church Members, not in Things disapproved, but highly approved
and commended by their Father the <i>Pope</i> and all his <i>Clients</i>, as the most
beneficial Casualty of all his Revenue,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Pope<i>’s Doctrine of </i>Merits<i>, the most beneficial of all his </i>Revenue.</span>we shall find that <i>Luther</i> did
not without great Ground oppose himself to them in this Matter: And
if he had not run himself into another Extreme, of which hereafter,
his Work would have stood the better. For in this, as in most other
Things, he is more to be commended for what he pulled down of
<i>Babylon</i>, than for what he built of his own. Whatever then the <i>Papists</i>
may pretend, or even some good Men among them may have
thought, Experience sheweth, and it is more than manifest by the
universal and approved Practice of their People, that they place not
their <i>Justification</i> so much in Works that are truly and morally good,
and in the being truly renewed and sanctified in the Mind, as in
such Things as are either nor Good nor Evil, or may truly be called
Evil, and can no otherwise be reckoned Good than because the <i>Pope</i>
pleases to call them so.
<span class="sidenote">Papists <i>Justification depends upon the </i>Pope<i>’s Bulls.</i></span>So that if the Matter be well sifted, it will
be found, that the greatest Part of their <i>Justification</i> depends upon the
Authority of his <i>Bulls</i>, and not upon the Power, Virtue, and Grace
of Christ revealed in the Heart, and renewing of it, as will appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 1. <i>Their Sacraments.</i></span><i>First</i>, From their Principle concerning their <i>Sacraments</i>, which they
say confer Grace <i>ex opere operato</i>. So that if a Man partake but of
them, he thereby obtains Remission of Sin, though he remains as he
was; the Virtue of the <i>Sacraments</i> making up the Want that is in
the Man. So that this Act of Submission and Faith to the Laws of
the Church, and not any real inward Change, is that which justifieth
him. As for Example;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Papists Penance.</i></span>if a Man make use of the <i>Sacrament</i>, as
they call it, <i>of Penance</i>, so as to tell over his Sins to a Priest, though
he have not true <i>Contrition</i>, which the Lord hath made absolutely
necessary for penitent Sinners, but only <i>Attrition</i>, a Figment of their
own, that is, if he be sorry he hath sinned, not out of any Love to
God, or his Law which he hath transgressed, but for fear of Punishment,
yet doth the Virtue of the <i>Sacrament</i>, as they affirm, procure
to him Remission of Sins; so that being absolved by the Priest, he
stands accepted and justified in the Sight of God. This Man’s Justification
then proceedeth not from his being truly penitent, and in
any Measure inwardly changed and renewed by the working of God’s
Grace in his Heart, but merely from the Virtue of the <i>Sacrament</i>, and
Authority of the Priest, who hath pronounced him <i>absolved</i>; so that
his Justification is from somewhat without him, and not within him.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2. <i>Papist Indulgences.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This will yet more appear in the Matter of <i>Indulgences</i>,
where Remission of all Sins, not only past but for Years to come, is
annexed to the visiting such and such <i>Churches</i> and <i>Reliques</i>, saying
such and such <i>Prayers</i>; so that the Person that so doth is presently
cleared from the Guilt of his Sin, and justified and accepted in the
Sight of God. As for Example: He that in the great <i>Jubilee</i> will go
to <i>Rome</i>, and present himself before the Gate of <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i>, and
there receive the <i>Pope’s Blessing</i>; or he that will go a Pilgrimage to
<i>James</i>’s Sepulchre in <i>Spain</i>, or to <i>Mary</i> of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Loretto"><i>Loreto</i></span>, is upon the Performance
of those Things promised Forgiveness of Sins. Now if we
ask them the Reason how such Things as are not morally good in
themselves come to have Virtue? They have no other Answer but
<i>because of the Church and Pope’s Authority</i>, who being the great Treasurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
of the Magazine of <i>Christ’s Merits</i>, lets them out upon such and such
Conditions.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Papists Mass, what it is?</i></span>Thus also the Invention of saying <i>Mass</i> is made a
chief Instrument of <i>Justification</i>; for in it they pretend to offer <i>Christ</i>
daily to the Father a <i>propitiatory Sacrifice</i> for the Sins of the Living and
Dead: So that a Man for Money can procure <i>Christ</i> thus to be offered
for him when he pleases; by which Offering he is said to obtain
Remission of Sins, and to stand justified in the Sight of God. From
all which, and much more of this Nature which might be mentioned,
it doth appear, that the <i>Papists</i> place their Justification, not so much
in any Work of Holiness really brought forth in them, and real forsaking
of Iniquity, as in the mere Performance of some Ceremonies,
and a blind Belief which their Teachers have begotten in them, that
the <i>Church</i> and the <i>Pope</i> having the absolute Dispensation of the <i>Merits
of Christ</i>, have Power to make these Merits effectual for the Remission
of Sins, and Justification of such as will perform those Ceremonies.
This is the true and real Method of <i>Justification</i> taken by
the Generality of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and highly commended by their
publick Preachers, especially the <i>Monks</i>, in their Sermons to the
People, of which I myself have been an Ear and an Eye-witness;
however some of their modern Writers have laboured to qualify it in
their Controversies.
<span class="sidenote">Luther<i> and the </i>Protestants<i> opposing the Pope’s Doctrine of Works, fell into the other Extreme, of no good Works necessary to Justification.</i></span>This Doctrine <i>Luther</i> and the <i>Protestants</i> then
had good Reason to deny and oppose; though many of them ran
into another Extreme, so as to deny <i>good Works to be necessary to Justification</i>,
and to preach up <i>not only Remission of Sins, but Justification
by Faith alone, without all Works, however good</i>. So that Men do
not obtain their <i>Justification</i> according as they are inwardly sanctified
and renewed, but are justified merely by believing that <i>Christ died
for them</i>; and so some may be perfectly justified, though they be lying
in gross Wickedness; as appears by the Example of <i>David</i>, who they
say was fully and perfectly justified while he was lying in the gross
Sins of <i>Murder</i> and <i>Adultery</i>. As then the <i>Protestants</i> have sufficient
Ground to quarrel and confute the <i>Papists</i> concerning those many
Abuses in the Matter of <i>Justification</i>, shewing how the <i>Doctrine of Christ</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
is thereby vitiated and overturned, and the <i>Word at God</i> made void
by many and useless Traditions, the <i>Law of God</i> neglected, while
foolish and needless <i>Ceremonies</i> are prized and followed, through a
false Opinion of being justified by the Performance of them; and
the <i>Merits</i> and <i>Sufferings</i> of Christ, which is the only <i>Sacrifice</i> appointed
of God for Remission of Sins, derogated from, by the setting up of
a daily <i>Sacrifice</i> never appointed by God, and chiefly devised out of
Covetousness to get Money by;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Papists Device to get Money.</i></span>so the <i>Protestants</i> on the other Hand,
by not rightly establishing and holding forth the <i>Doctrine</i> of <i>Justification</i>
according as it is delivered in the holy Scriptures, have opened
a Door for the <i>Papists</i> to accuse them, as if they were Neglecters of
good Works, Enemies to Mortification and Holiness, such as esteem
themselves justified while lying in great Sins: By which Kind of
Accusations, for which too great Ground hath been given out of the
Writings of some <i>rigid Protestants</i>, the Reformation hath been greatly
defamed and hindered, and the Souls of many insnared. Whereas,
whoever will narrowly look into the Matter, may observe these Debates
to be more <i>in Specie</i> than <i>in Genere</i>, seeing both do upon the
Matter <i>land in one</i>; and like two Men in a Circle, who though they
go sundry Ways, yet meet at last; in the same Center.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Papists Belief of Justification meets in the same Center with the&mdash;</i></span>For the <i>Papists</i> say, <i>They obtain Remission of Sins, and are justified by the
Merits of Christ, as the same are applied unto them in the Use of the Sacraments
of the Church, and are dispensed in the Performance of such and such
Ceremonies, Pilgrimages, Prayers, and Performances, though there be not
any inward renewing of the Mind, nor knowing of Christ inwardly formed;
yet they are remitted and made righteous </i>ex opere operato<i>, because of the
Power and Authority accompanying the Sacraments and the Dispensers of
them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">&mdash;<i>Protestants Belief. So saith the </i>Westminster Confession<i> of </i>Faith<i>. Chap. 11. Sect. 1.</i></span>The <i>Protestants</i> say, <i>That they obtain Remission of Sins, and stand justified
in the Sight of God by Virtue of the </i>Merits<i> and </i>Sufferings<i> of Christ, not by
infusing Righteousness into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting
and accepting their Persons as righteous, they resting on him and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
Righteousness by</i> Faith; <i>which</i> Faith, <i>the Act of believing, is not imputed
unto them for Righteousness</i>.</p>

<p>So the <i>Justification</i> of neither here is placed in any inward Renewing
of the Mind, or by Virtue of any spiritual Birth, or Formation of
Christ in them; but only by a bare Application of the Death and Sufferings
of Christ outwardly performed for them: Whereof the one
lays hold on a Faith resting upon them, and hoping to be justified
by them alone; the other by the saying of some outward Prayers and
Ceremonies, which they judge makes the Death of Christ effectual
unto them. I except here, being unwilling to wrong any, what
Things have been said as to the Necessity of inward Holiness, either
by some <i>modern Papists</i>, or some <i>modern Protestants</i>, who, in so far as
they have laboured after a Midst betwixt these two Extremes, have
come near to the Truth, as by some Citations out of them hereafter
to be mentioned will appear: Though this Doctrine hath not since
the Apostasy, so far as ever I could observe, been so distinctly and
evidently held forth according to the Scripture’s Testimony, as it
hath pleased God to reveal it and preach it forth in this Day, by the
Witnesses of his Truth whom he hath raised to that End; which
<i>Doctrine</i>, though it be briefly held forth and comprehended in the
Thesis itself,
<span class="sidenote"><i>State of the Controversy.</i></span>yet I shall a little more fully explain, and shew the
State of the Controversy as it stands betwixt us and those that now
oppose us.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Expl. 1.</span><i>First</i> then, as by the Explanation of the former Thesis appears,
we renounce all natural Power and Ability in ourselves, in
order to bring us out of our lost and fallen Condition and first Nature;
and confess, that as of ourselves we are able to do nothing
that is good, so neither can we procure Remission of Sins or Justification
by any Act of our own, so as to merit it, or draw it as a
Debt from God due unto us;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Justification springs </i>of<i> and </i>from<i> the Love of God.</i></span>but we acknowledge all to be <i>of</i> and
<i>from</i> his <i>Love</i>, which is the original and fundamental Cause of our
Acceptance.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Expl. 2.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Christ giving himself a Sacrifice for us.</i></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, God manifested this <i>Love</i> towards us, in the sending of
his beloved Son the Lord <i>Jesus Christ</i> into the World, who gave himself
for us an <i>Offering</i> and a <i>Sacrifice</i> to God, for a <i>sweet-smelling Savour</i>;
and having made Peace through the Blood of his <i>Cross</i>, that he
might reconcile us unto himself, and by the Eternal Spirit offered
himself without Spot unto God, and suffered for our Sins, the <i>Just</i>
for the <i>Unjust</i>, that he might bring us unto God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Expl. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i> then, Forasmuch as all Men who have come to Man’s
Estate (the Man <i>Jesus</i> only excepted) have sinned, therefore all have
Need of this Saviour, to remove the Wrath of God from them due
to their Offences; in this Respect he is truly said to <i>have borne the
Iniquities of us all in his Body on the Tree</i>, and therefore is the <i>only Mediator</i>,
having qualified the Wrath of God towards us; so that our
former Sins stand not in our Way, being by Virtue of his most
satisfactory Sacrifice removed and pardoned.
<span class="sidenote"><i>To Remission of Sins.</i></span>Neither do we think
that Remission of Sins is to be expected, sought, or obtained any
other Way, or by any Works or Sacrifice whatsoever; though,
as has been said formerly, they may come to partake of this Remission
that are ignorant of the History.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The only Mediator betwixt God and Man.</i></span>So then Christ by his Death
and Sufferings hath reconciled us to God, even while we are Enemies;
that is, he offers Reconciliation unto us; we are put into a
Capacity of being reconciled; God is willing to forgive us our
Iniquities, and to accept us, as is well expressed by the Apostle,
2 <i>Cor.</i> v. 19. <i>God was in Christ, reconciling the World unto himself, not
imputing their Trespasses unto them, and hath put in us the Word of Reconciliation</i>.
And therefore the Apostle, in the next Verses, intreats them
in <i>Christ’s Stead to be reconciled to God</i>; intimating that the Wrath of
God being removed by the Obedience of <i>Christ Jesus</i>, he is willing to
be reconciled unto them, and ready to remit the Sins that are past,
if they repent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>A twofold Redemption.</i></span>We consider then our Redemption in a <span class="correction" title="In the original book: two-fold">twofold</span> Respect or State,
both which in their own Nature are perfect, though in their Application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
to us the one is not, nor <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: cannot">can</span> be, without Respect to the
other.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">I. <i>The Redemption of Christ without us.</i></span>The First is the Redemption performed and accomplished by <i>Christ
for us</i> in his crucified Body without us: The other is the Redemption
wrought by <i>Christ in us</i>, which no less properly is called and accounted
a Redemption than the former. The first then is that
whereby a Man, as he stands in the Fall, is put into a Capacity of
Salvation, and hath conveyed unto him a Measure of that Power,
Virtue, Spirit, Life, and Grace that was in <i>Christ Jesus</i>, which, as the
free Gift of God, is able to counter-balance, overcome, and root out
the evil Seed, wherewith we are naturally, as in the Fall, leavened.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>The Redemption wrought by Christ in us.</i></span>The Second is that whereby we witness and know this pure and
perfect Redemption <i>in ourselves</i>, purifying, cleansing, and redeeming
us from the Power of Corruption, and bringing us into Unity, Favour,
and Friendship with God. By the first of these two, we that
were lost in <i>Adam</i>, plunged into the bitter and corrupt Seed, unable
of ourselves to do any good Thing, but naturally joined and united
to Evil, forward and propense to all Iniquity, Servants and Slaves
to the Power and Spirit of Darkness, are, notwithstanding all this,
so far reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, while Enemies,
that we are put into a Capacity of Salvation, having the glad Tidings
of the Gospel of Peace offered unto us, and God is reconciled unto
us in Christ, calls and invites us to himself, in which Respect we
understand these Scriptures; <a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><i>He slew the Enmity in himself. He loved
us first; seeing us in our Blood, he said unto us, Live; he who did not sin
his own self, bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree; and he died for our
Sin, the Just for the Unjust.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Eph. 2. 15. 1 John 4. 10. Ezek. 16. 6.
1 Pet. 2. 22, 24. &amp; 3. 18.</p></div>

<p>By the Second, we witness this Capacity brought into Act, whereby
receiving and not resisting the Purchase of his Death, to wit, the
Light, Spirit, and Grace of Christ revealed in us, we witness and
possess a real, true, and inward Redemption from the Power and
Prevalency of Sin, and so come to be truly and really redeemed,
justified, and made righteous, and to a sensible Union and Friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
with God.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Thus <i>he died for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity</i>;
and thus <i>we know him and the Power of his Resurrection, and the Fellowship
of his Sufferings, being made conformable to his Death</i>. This last follows
the first in Order, and is a Consequence of it, proceeding from it,
as an <i>Effect</i> from its <i>Cause</i>: So as none could have enjoyed the last,
without the first had been, such being the Will of God; so also can
none now partake of the first, but as he witnesseth the last. Wherefore
as to us, they are both Causes of our Justification; the first the
<i>procuring Efficient</i>, the other the <i>formal Cause</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> Tit. 2. 14. Phil. 3. 10.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Expl. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, We understand not by this <i>Justification by Christ</i> barely the
<i>good Works even wrought by the Spirit of Christ</i>; for they, as <i>Protestants</i>
truly affirm, are rather an Effect of <i>Justification</i> than the Cause of it;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Formation of Christ in us begets good Works.</i></span>but we understand the <i>Formation of Christ in us, Christ born and brought
forth in us</i>, from which good Works as naturally proceed as Fruit from
a fruitful Tree. It is this <i>inward Birth in us, bringing forth Righteousness
and Holiness in us, that doth justify us</i>; which having removed and
done away the contrary Nature and Spirit that did bear Rule and bring
Condemnation, now is in Dominion over all <i>in</i> our Hearts. Those
then that come to know <i>Christ</i> thus formed in them, do enjoy him
wholly and undivided, who is <i>the LORD our RIGHTEOUSNESS</i>,
Jer. xxiii. 6. This is to be clothed with <i>Christ</i>, and to have put him on,
whom God therefore truly accounteth righteous and just. This is so
far from being the Doctrine of <i>Papists</i>, that as the Generality of them
do not understand it, so the Learned among them oppose it, and dispute
against it, and particularly <i>Bellarmine</i>. Thus then, as I may
say, the formal Cause of Justification is not the Works, to speak properly,
they being but an Effect of it; but this inward Birth, this <i>Jesus</i>
brought forth in the Heart, who is the well-beloved, whom the
Father cannot but accept, and all those who thus are sprinkled with
the <i>Blood of Jesus</i>, and washed with it. By this also comes that Communication
of the Goods of <i>Christ</i> unto us, <i>by which we come to be made
Partakers of the divine Nature</i>, as faith <i>Peter</i>, 2 <i>Pet.</i> i. 4. and are made
one with him, as the Branches with the Vine, and have a Title and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
Right to what he hath done and suffered for us;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s Obedience, Righteousness, Death and Sufferings are ours.</i></span>so that his Obedience
becomes ours, his Righteousness ours, his Death and Sufferings
ours. And by this Nearness we come to have a Sense of his Sufferings,
and to suffer with his Seed, that yet lies pressed and crucified
in the Hearts of the Ungodly, and so travail with it, and for its Redemption,
and for the Repentance of those Souls that in it are crucifying
as yet the <i>Lord of Glory</i>. Even as the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, <i>who by
his Sufferings </i>is said to<i> fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Christ
for his Body, which is the Church</i>. Though this be a Mystery sealed up
from all the wise Men that are yet ignorant of this Seed in themselves,
and oppose it, nevertheless some <i>Protestants</i> speak of this justification
by <i>Christ</i> inwardly put on, as shall hereafter be recited in its Place.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Expl. 5.</span><i>Lastly</i>, Though we place Remission of Sins in the <i>Righteousness and
Obedience of Christ performed by him in the Flesh</i>, as to what pertains to
the remote procuring Cause, and that we hold ourselves <i>formally
justified by Christ Jesus formed and brought forth in us</i>, yet can we not, as
some <i>Protestants</i> have unwarily done, <i>exclude</i> Works from <i>Justification</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Good Works are not excluded Justification.</i></span>For though properly we be not justified <i>for them</i>, yet are we justified <i>in
them</i>; and they are necessary, even as <i>Causa sine quâ non</i>, i. e. <i>the Cause,
without which none are justified</i>. For the denying of this, as it is contrary
to the Scripture’s Testimony, so it hath brought a great Scandal
to the Protestant Religion, opened the Mouths of <i>Papists</i>, and
made many too secure, while they have believed to be justified without
good Works. Moreover, though it be not so safe to say <i>they are
meritorious</i>, yet seeing they are rewarded, many of those called the
<i>Fathers</i> have not spared to use the Word [<i>Merit</i>] which some of us
have perhaps also done in a qualified Sense, but <span class="correction" title="In the original book: noways">no-ways</span> to infer
the <i>Popish Abuses</i> above-mentioned. And <i>lastly</i>, if we had that Notion
of <i>good Works</i> which most <i>Protestants</i> have, we could freely agree
to make them not only not necessary, but reject them as hurtful,
viz. <i>That the best Works even of the Saints are defiled and polluted.</i> For
though we judge so of the best Works performed by Man, endeavouring
a Conformity to the outward Law by his own Strength, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
in his own Will, yet we believe that such <i>Works</i> as naturally proceed
from this spiritual Birth and Formation of Christ in us are <i>pure</i>
and <i>holy</i>, even as the <i>Root</i> from which they come; and therefore God
accepts them, justifies us in them, and rewards us for them of his
own <i>free Grace</i>. The State of the Controversy being thus laid down,
these following <i>Positions</i> do from hence arise in the next Place to be
proved.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Posit. 1.</span>First, <i>That the Obedience, Sufferings, and Death of Christ is that
by which the Soul obtains Remission of Sins, and is the procuring Cause of that
Grace, by whose inward Workings </i>Christ<i> comes to be formed inwardly, and
the Soul to be made conformable unto him, and so just and justified.</i> And
that therefore, in respect of this Capacity and Offer of Grace, <i>God</i> is
said to be <i>reconciled</i>; not as if he were actually <i>reconciled</i>, or did actually
justify, or account any just, so long as they remain in their
Sins really impure and unjust.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Posit. 2.</span>Secondly, <i>That it is by this inward Birth of Christ in Man that Man is
made just, and therefore so accounted by God</i>: Wherefore, to be plain, we
are thereby, and not till that be brought forth in us, <i>formally</i>, if we
must use that Word, <i>justified</i> in the Sight of God; because <i>Justification</i>
is both more properly and frequently in Scripture taken in its proper
Signification for making one just, and not reputing one merely
such, and is all one with <i>Sanctification</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Posit. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, That since <i>good Works</i> as naturally follow from this Birth
as Heat from Fire, therefore are they of <i>absolute Necessity to Justification</i>, as
<i>Causa sine quâ non</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Good Works are </i>Causa sine quâ non&mdash;of<i> Justification.</i></span>i. e. though not as the Cause <i>for which</i>, yet as that
<i>in which</i> we are, and without which we cannot be justified. And
though they be not <i>meritorious</i>, and draw no Debt upon God, yet he
cannot but accept and reward them: For it is contrary to his Nature
to deny his own, since they may be perfect in their Kind, as
proceeding from a pure holy Birth and Root. Wherefore their Judgment
is false and against the Truth that say, <i>That the holiest Works of the
Saints are defiled and sinful in the Sight of God</i>: For these <i>good Works</i> are
not the Works of the Law, excluded by the Apostle from Justification.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span></p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Posit. 1.</span>As to the first, I prove it from <i>Rom.</i> iii. 25. <i>Whom God hath
set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness
for the Remission of Sins that are past, through the Forbearance of
God</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Proof I. <i>The Efficacy of Christ’s Death to redeem Man out of Evil.</i></span>Here the Apostle holds forth the Extent and Efficacy of <i>Christ’s
Death</i>, shewing that thereby, and by Faith therein, Remission of Sins
that are past is obtained, as being that wherein the Forbearance of
God is exercised towards Mankind. So that though Men for the
Sins they daily commit deserve eternal Death, and that the Wrath of
God should lay hold upon them; yet, by Virtue of that most <i>satisfactory
Sacrifice of Christ Jesus</i>, the Grace and Seed of God moves in
Love towards them, during the Day of their Visitation; yet not so as
not to strike against the Evil, for that must be burnt up and destroyed,
but to redeem Man out of the Evil.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof II.</span><i>Secondly</i>, If God were perfectly reconciled with Men, and did
esteem them just while they are actually unjust, and do continue in
their Sins, then should God have no Controversy with them<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; how
comes he then so often to complain, and to expostulate so much
throughout the whole Scripture with such as our Adversaries confess
to be justified, telling them, <i>That their Sins separate betwixt him and them</i>?
Isa. lix. 2. For where there is a perfect and full Reconciliation, there
is no Separation. Yea, from this Doctrine it necessarily follows,
either that such for whom <i>Christ</i> died, and whom he hath reconciled,
never sin, or that when they do so, they are still reconciled, and
their Sins make not the least Separation from God; yea, that they
are justified in their Sins. From whence also would follow this
abominable Consequence, that the good Works and greatest Sins of
such are alike in the Sight of God, seeing neither the one serves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
to justify them, nor the other to break their Reconciliation, which
occasions great Security, and opens a Door to every lewd Practice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> I do not only speak concerning Men before <i>Conversion</i>, who afterwards are converted,
whom yet some of our Antagonists, called <i>Antinomians</i>, do aver were justified from the Beginning;
but also touching those who according to the common Opinion of <i>Protestants</i> have been converted;
whom albeit they confess they persist always in some <i>Misdeeds</i>, and sometimes in <i>heinous
Sins</i>, as is manifest in <i>David</i>’s Adultery and Murder, yet they assert to be perfectly and
wholly justified.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof III.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, This would make void the whole practical Doctrine of
the Gospel, and make Faith itself needless. For if Faith and Repentance,
and the other Conditions called for throughout the Gospel,
be a Qualification upon our Part necessary to be performed,
then, before this be performed by us, we are either fully reconciled
to God, or but in a Capacity of being reconciled to God, he being
ready to reconcile and justify us as these Conditions are performed;
which latter, if granted, is according to the Truth we profess. And
if we are already perfectly reconciled and justified before these Conditions
are performed (which Conditions are of that Nature that
they cannot be performed at one Time, but are to be done all one’s
Life-time) then can they not be said to be absolutely needful; which
is contrary to the very express Testimony of Scripture, which is acknowledged
by all Christians: <a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><i>For without Faith it is impossible to please
God. They that believe not are condemned already, because they believe not
in the only begotten Son of God. Except ye repent, ye cannot be saved: For
if ye live after the Flesh, ye shall die</i>. And of those that were converted;
<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><i>I will remove your Candlestick from you, unless ye repent</i>. Should I mention
all the Scriptures that positively and evidently prove this, I might
transcribe much of all the doctrinal Part of the <i>Bible</i>. For since
Christ said, <i>It is finished</i>, and did <i>finish his Work</i> sixteen hundred Years
ago and upwards;
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Door of Mercy opened by Christ, upon Repentance.</i></span>if he so fully perfected Redemption then, and did
actually reconcile every one that is to be saved, not simply opening
a Door of Mercy for them, offering the Sacrifice of his Body, by
which they may obtain Remission of their Sins when they repent,
and communicating unto them a Measure of his Grace, by which
they may see their Sins, and be able to repent;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Antinomians<i> Opinion of Reconciliation and Justification.</i></span>but really making
them to be reputed as just, either before they believe, as say the <i>Antinomians</i>,
or after they have assented to the Truth of the History of
Christ, or are sprinkled with the Baptism of Water, while nevertheless
they are actually unjust, so that no Part of their Redemption is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
to be wrought by him now, as to their <i>Reconciliation</i> and <i>Justification</i>;
then the whole doctrinal Part of the <i>Bible</i> is useless, and of no Profit:
in vain were the Apostles sent forth to preach Repentance and Remission
of Sins; and in vain do all the Preachers bestow their <i>Labour</i>,
spend their <i>Breath</i>, and give forth <i>Writings</i>; yea, much more
in vain do the People spend their Money which they give them for
Preaching; seeing it is all but <i>Actum agere</i>, but a vain and ineffectual
Essay, to do that which is already perfectly done without them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Heb. 11. 6. John 3. 18. Luke 13. 3. Rom. 8. 13.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> Apoc. 2. 5.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 4.</span>But <i>lastly</i>, To pass by their human Labours, as not worth the Disputing
whether they be needful or not, since (as we shall hereafter
shew) themselves confess the <i>best</i> of them is <i>sinful</i>; this also makes
void the present Intercession of Christ for Men.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s daily making Intercession for us.</i></span>What will become
of that great Article of Faith, by which we affirm, <i>That he sits at the
right Hand of God, daily making Intercession for us; and for which End the
Spirit itself maketh Intercession for us with Groanings which cannot be uttered?</i>
For Christ maketh not Intercession for those that are not in a Possibility
of Salvation; that is absurd. Our Adversaries will not admit
that he prayed for the World at all; and to pray for those that
are already reconciled, and perfectly justified, is to no Purpose: To
pray for Remission of Sins is yet more needless, if all be remitted,
past, present, and to come. Indeed there is not any solid solving
of this, but by acknowledging according to the <i>Truth</i>, That Christ
by his Death removed the Wrath of God, so far as to obtain Remission
of Sins for as many as receive that <i>Grace</i> and <i>Light</i> that he communicates
unto them, and hath purchased for them by his <i>Blood</i>;
which, as they believe in, they come to know Remission of Sins past,
and Power to save them from Sin, and to wipe it away, so often as
they may fall into it by Unwatchfulness or Weakness, if, applying
themselves to this Grace, they truly repent; for <i>to as many as receive
him, he gives Power to become the Sons of God</i>: So none are <i>Sons</i>, none
are <i>justified</i>, none <i>reconciled</i>, until they thus receive him in that little
<i>Seed</i> in their Hearts: <i>And Life eternal is offered to those, who by patient
Continuance in Well-doing, seek for Glory, Honour, and Immortality: For if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
the righteous Man depart from his Righteousness, his Righteousness shall be
remembered no more</i>. And therefore on the other Part, none are longer
Sons of God, and justified, than they patiently continue in Righteousness
and Well-doing. And therefore Christ lives always making
Intercession, during the Day of every Man’s Visitation, that they
may be converted; And when Men are in some Measure converted,
he makes Intercession that they may continue and go on, and not
faint, nor go back again. Much more might be said to confirm
this Truth; but I go on to take Notice of the common Objections
against it, which are the Arguments made use of to propagate the
<i>Errors</i> contrary to it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3> The <i>first</i> and <i>chief</i> is drawn from that Saying of the Apostle
before-mentioned, 2 <i>Cor.</i> v. 18, 19. <i>God hath reconciled us to himself by
Jesus Christ: God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing
their Trespasses unto them.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>From hence they seek to infer, <i>That Christ fully perfected the Work of
Reconciliation while he was on Earth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; If by [<i>Reconciliation</i>] be understood the removing of
Wrath, and the Purchase of that Grace by which we may come to
be reconciled, we agree to it; but that that Place speaks no more,
appears from the Place itself: For when the Apostle speaks in the
<i>perfect Time</i>, saying, <i>He hath reconciled us</i>, he speaks of himself and the
Saints; who having received the Grace of God purchased by Christ,
were through Faith in him actually reconciled.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Difference between </i>Reconciled<i> to Christ, and </i>Reconciling.</span>But as to the <i>World</i>,
he saith [<i>reconciling</i>] not [<i>reconciled</i>]; which <i>Reconciling</i>, though it
denotes a Time somewhat past, yet it is by the <i>imperfect Time</i>, denoting
that the Thing begun was not perfected. For this Work
Christ began towards all in the Days of his Flesh, yea, and long before;
for <i>He was the Mediator from the Beginning, and the Lamb slain
from the Foundation of the World</i>: But in his Flesh, after he had perfectly
<i>fulfilled the Law</i>, and the <i>Righteousness</i> thereof, had rent the <i>Veil</i>,
and made Way for the more clear and universal Revelation of the
Gospel to all, both <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i>; he <i>gave up himself a most satisfac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>tory
Sacrifice for Sin</i>; which becomes effectual to as many as receive
him in his inward Appearance, in his <i>Light</i> in the Heart. Again,
this very Place sheweth that no other Reconciliation is intended, but
the Opening of a Door of Mercy upon God’s Part, and a Removing of
Wrath for Sins that are past; so as Men; notwithstanding their Sins,
are stated in a Capacity of Salvation: For the Apostle, in the following
Verse, saith, <i>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
you by us; we pray you in Christ’s Stead be ye reconciled to God</i>. For if
their <i>Reconciliation</i> had already been perfectly accomplished, what need
any Intreating then to be reconciled? <i>Ambassadors</i> are not sent after
a <i>Peace</i> already perfected, and Reconciliation made, to intreat for a
Reconciliation; for that implies a manifest Contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object, <i>Ver.</i> 21st of the same Chapter, <i>For he hath
made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him</i>. From whence they argue, <i>That as our
Sin is imputed to Christ, who had no Sin; so Christ’s Righteousness is imputed
to us, without our being righteous</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But this Interpretation is easily rejected; for though <i>Christ bare our
Sins, </i>and<i> suffered for us, </i>and was among Men<i> accounted a Sinner, </i>and<i>
numbered among Transgressors</i>; yet that God reputed him a Sinner, is
no where proved. For it is said, <a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><i>He was found before him holy, harmless,
and undefiled, neither was there found any Guile in his Mouth</i>. That
we deserved these Things, and much more for our Sins, which he
endured in Obedience to the Father; and according to his Counsel,
is true; but that ever reputed him a <i>Sinner</i>, is denied:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Men’s imputed Righteousness solidly Refuted.</i></span>Neither
did he ever die, that <i>we</i> should be reputed righteous, though no more
really such than <i>he</i> was a Sinner, as hereafter appears. For indeed,
if this Argument hold, it might be stretched to that Length, as to
become very pleasing to wicked Men that love to abide in their Sins:
For if we be made <i>righteous, as Christ was made a Sinner, merely by Imputation;
then as there was no Sin, not in the least in Christ, </i>so it would
follow<i>, that there needed no more Righteousness, no more Holiness, no more
inward Sanctification in us, than there was Sin in him</i>. So then, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
[<i>being made Sin for us</i>] must be understood his Suffering for our Sins,
that we might be made Partakers of the Grace purchased by him;
by the Workings whereof we are made the Righteousness of God in
him. For that the Apostle understood here a being made really
righteous, and not merely a being reputed such, appears by what
follows, seeing in <i>Ver.</i> 14, 15, 16. of the following Chapter, he argues
largely against any supposed <i>Agreement of Light and Darkness</i>,
<i>Righteousness and Unrighteousness</i>; which must needs be admitted, if
Men are to be reckoned ingrafted in Christ, and real Members of
him, merely by an imputative Righteousness, wholly without them,
while they themselves are actually unrighteous. And indeed it may be
thought strange, how some Men have made this so fundamental an
Article of their Faith, which is so contrary to the whole Strain of the
Gospel: A Thing which Christ in none of all his <i>Sermons</i> and <i>gracious
Speeches</i> ever willed any to rely upon; always recommending to
us Works, as instrumental in our justification. And the more it is
to be admired at, because that Sentence or Term (so frequently in
their Mouths, and so often pressed by them, as the very <i>Basis</i> of their
Hope and Confidence) to wit,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s imputed Righteousness not found in all the</i> Bible.</span><i>The imputed Righteousness of Christ</i>, is not
to be found in all the <i>Bible</i>, at least as to my Observation. Thus have I
passed through the first Part, and that the more briefly, because many,
who assert this <i>Justification</i> by bare Imputation, do nevertheless confess,
that even the Elect are not justified until they be converted; that is,
not until this imputative Justification be applied to them by the Spirit.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Posit. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: 1.">2.</span> <i>By Christ formed within we are justified.</i></span>I come then to the second Thing proposed by me, which
is; <i>That it is by this inward Birth, or Christ formed within, that we are </i>(so
to speak)<i> formally justified in the Sight of God</i>. I suppose I have said
enough already to demonstrate how much we ascribe to the <i>Death</i>
and <i>Sufferings of Christ</i>, as that whereby Satisfaction is made to the
Justice of God, Remission of Sins obtained, and this <i>Grace</i> and <i>Seed</i>
purchased, by and from which this Birth proceeds. The Thing now to
be proved is, <i>That by Christ Jesus formed in us, we are justified, or made just</i>.
Let it be marked, I use <i>Justification</i> in this Sense upon this Occasion.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 1.</span><i>First</i> then, I prove this by that of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 11.
<span class="sidenote">Justified, i. e. <i>being made Just really, not by Imputation</i>.</span><i>And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God</i>. First,
This [<i>justified</i>] here understood, must needs be <i>a being really made just</i>,
and not <i>a being merely imputed such</i>; else [<i>sanctified</i>] and [<i>washed</i>] might be
reputed a being <i>esteemed</i> so, and not a being <i>really</i> so; and then it
quite overturns the whole Intent of the Context. For the Apostle
shewing them in the preceding <i>Verses</i>, how the <i>Unrighteous cannot inherit
the Kingdom of God</i>, and descending to the several <i>Species of Wickedness</i>,
subsumes, <i>That they were sometimes such, but now are not any more such</i>.
Wherefore, as they are now <i>washed</i> and <i>sanctified</i>, so are they <i>justified</i>:
For if this <i>Justification</i> were not <i>real</i>, then it might be alleged that the
<i>Corinthians</i> had not forsaken these Evils; but, though they still continued
in them, were notwithstanding <i>justified</i>: Which as in itself it is
most absurd, so it very clearly overturneth the very Import and Intent
of the Place; as if the <i>Corinthians</i> turning <i>Christians</i> had not
wrought any real Change in them, but had only been a Belief of some
barren Notions, which had wrought no Alteration in their Affections,
Will, or Manner of Life. For my own Part, I neither see any Thing,
nor could ever yet hear or read any Thing, that with any Colour of
Reason did evince [<i>Justified</i>] in this Place to be understood any other
ways than in its own proper and genuine Interpretation of being made
<i>just</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Derivation of the Word </i>Justify<i> considered</i>, &amp;c.</span>And for the more clear understanding hereof, let it be considered,
that this Word [<i>justify</i>] is derived either from the Substantive <i>Justice</i>,
or the Adjective <i>just</i>: Both which Words import the <i>Substantive</i>, that
true and real <i>Virtue in the Soul</i>, as it is in itself; to wit, it signifies <i>really</i>,
and not <i>suppositively</i>, that excellent Quality expressed and understood
among Men by the Word [<i>Justice</i>;] and the Adjective [<i>just</i>] as applied,
signifies a Man or Woman who is <i>just</i>, that is, in whom this
Quality of <i>Justice</i> is stated: For it would not only be great Impropriety,
but also manifest Falsity, to call a Man <i>just</i>; merely by <i>Supposition</i>;
especially if he were really <i>unjust</i>. Now this Word [<i>justify</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
formed from <i>Justice</i>, or <i>just</i>, doth beyond all Question signify a <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: make-ing">making</span>
just</i>; it being nothing else but a Composition of the Verb <i>Facio</i>,
and the Adjective <i>justus</i>, which is nothing else than thus, <i>justifico</i>, i. e.
<i>justum facio</i>, I make just, and [<i>justified</i>] of <i>justus</i> and <i>fio</i>, as <i>justus fio</i>, I
become just, and <i>justificatus</i>, i. e. <i>justus factus</i>, I am made just. Thus
also is it with Verbs of this Kind, as, <i>sanctifico</i>, from <i>sanctus</i>, holy, and
<i>facio</i>; <i>honorifico</i>, from <i>honor</i> and <i>facio</i>; <i>sacrifico</i>, from <i>sacer</i> and <i>facio</i>:
All which are still understood of the Subject really and truly endued
with that Virtue and Quality from which the Verb is derived.
<span class="sidenote">Justified <i>none are while they actually remain</i> unjust.</span>Therefore, as none are said to be <i>sanctified</i> that are really <i>unholy</i>, while
they are such; so neither can any be truly said to be <i>justified</i>, while
they actually remain <i>unjust</i>. Only this Verb <i>justify</i> hath, in a metaphorical
and figurative Sense, been otherwise taken, to wit, in a <i>Law</i>
Sense; as when a Man really guilty of a Crime is freed from the Punishment
of his Sin, he is said to be <i>justified</i>; that is, put in the Place
as if he were <i>just</i>. For this Use of the Word hath proceeded from
that true Supposition, <i>That none ought to be acquitted, but the Innocent</i>.
Hence also that Manner of speaking, <i>I will justify such a Man</i>, or <i>I will
justify this or that</i>, is used from the Supposition that the Person and
Thing is really justifiable: And where there is an Error and Abuse
in the Matter, so far there is also in the Expression.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Paræus<i> de </i>Just.<i> Cont. </i>Bell.<i> L. 2. C. 7. P. 469.</i></span>This is so manifest and apparent, that <i>Paræus</i>, a chief Protestant,
and a <i>Calvinist</i> also in his Opinion, acknowledges this; “We never
at any Time said,” saith he, “nor thought, that the Righteousness
of Christ was imputed to us, that by him we should be named <i>formally
just</i>, and not be so, as we have divers Times already shewed;
for that would no less soundly fight with right Reason, than if a
guilty Man absolved in Judgment should say, That he himself was
<i>formally just</i> by the Clemency of the judge granting him his Life.”
Now is it not strange, that Men should be so facile in a Matter of
so great Concernment, as to build the Stress of their Acceptance
with God upon a mere borrowed and metaphorical Signification, to
the excluding, or at least esteeming that not necessary, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
which the Scripture saith expresly, <i>No Man shall ever see God</i>?
<span class="sidenote">Holiness<i> required; therefore </i>good Works<i> are.</i></span>For if
<i>Holiness</i> be requisite and necessary, of which this is said, then must
<i>good Works</i> also; unless our Adversaries can shew us an <i>holy Man</i> without
<i>good Works</i>. But, moreover, [<i>justified</i>] in this figurative Sense
is used for <i>approved</i>; and indeed for the most Part, if not always in
Scripture, when the Word [<i>justify</i>] is used, it is taken in the worst
Part; that is, that as the Use of the Word that way is an Usurpation,
so it is spoken of such as usurp the Thing to themselves, while it
properly doth not belong unto them; as will appear to those that
will be at the Pains to examine these Places. <i>Exod.</i> xxiii. 7. <i>Job</i> ix. 20.
&amp; xxvii. 5. <i>Prov.</i> xvii. 15. <i>Isa.</i> v. 23. <i>Jer.</i> iii. 11. <i>Ezek.</i> xvi. 51, 52.
<i>Luke</i> x. 29. &amp; xvi. 15. which are all spoken of Men <i>justifying the Wicked</i>,
or of <i>wicked Men justifying themselves</i>; that is, approving themselves in
their Wickedness. If it be at any Time in this Signification taken
in good Part, it is very seldom, and that so obvious and plain by the
Context, as leaves no Scruple. But the Question is not so much of
the Use of the <i>Word</i>, where it is passingly or occasionally used, as
where the very Doctrine of <i>Justification</i> is handled. Where indeed to
mistake it, <i>viz.</i> in its proper Place, so as to content ourselves with an
<i>imaginary Justification</i>, while God requires a <i>real</i>, is of most dangerous
Consequence. For the Disquisition of which let it be considered,
that in all these Places to the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Corinthians</i>, <i>Galatians</i>, and elsewhere,
where the Apostle handles this Theme, the Word may be
taken in its own proper Signification without any Absurdity. As,
where it is often asserted in the above-mentioned Epistles to the
<i>Romans</i> and <i>Galatians</i>,
<span class="">Justified, <i>in its proper Signification</i>.</span>That <i>a Man cannot be justified by the Law of
</i>Moses<i>, nor by the Works of the Law</i>; there is no Absurdity nor Danger
in understanding it according to its own proper Signification, to
wit, that a Man cannot be made <i>just</i> by the <i>Law of Moses</i>; seeing this
so well agrees with that Saying of the same Apostle, That <i>the Law
makes nothing perfect</i>. And also where it is said, <i>We are justified by Faith</i>,
it may be very well understood of being <i>made just</i>; seeing it is also
said, That <i>Faith purifies the Heart</i>; and no Doubt the <i>pure in Heart</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
just; and the <i>Just live by Faith</i>. Again, where it is said, <i>We are justified
by Grace, we are justified by Christ, we are justified by the Spirit</i>; it is no
ways absurd to understand it of being <i>made just</i>, seeing by his Spirit
and Grace he doth make Men <i>just</i>. But to understand it universally
the other Way, merely for <i>Acceptance</i> and <i>Imputation</i>, would infer great
Absurdities, as may be proved at large; but because I judged it
would be acknowledged, I forbear at present for Brevity’s Sake. But
further, in the most weighty Places where this Word <i>justify</i> is used
in Scripture, with an immediate Relation to the Doctrine of <i>Justification</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Justification <i>signifies a making just.</i></span>our Adversaries must needs acknowledge it to be understood
of <i>making just</i>, and not barely in the legal Acceptation: As First, in
that of 1 <i>Cor.</i> vi. 11. <i>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified</i>,
as I before have proved; which also many Protestants are
forced to acknowledge.
<span class="sidenote">Thysius<i> Disp. de </i>Just.<i> Thes. 3.</i></span>“Neither diffide we,” saith <i>Thysius</i>, “because
of the most great and strict Connexion, that <i>Justification</i> doth sometimes
seem also to comprehend <i>Sanctification</i> as a Consequence, as in
<i>Rom.</i> viii. 30. <i>Tit.</i> iii. 7. 1 <i>Cor.</i> vi. 11. <i>And such sometimes were ye, but ye are
washed</i>, &amp;c.” <i>Zanchius</i>, having spoken concerning this Sense of Justification,
adds, saying,
<span class="sidenote">Zanchius <i>in C. P. 2. ad</i> Eph. <i>V. 4. Loc. de</i> Just.</span>“There is another Signification of the Word,
<i>viz.</i> for a Man from <i>unjust</i> to be made <i>just</i>, even as <i>sanctified</i> signifies
from <i>unholy</i> to be made <i>holy</i>: In which Signification the Apostle
said, in the Place above-cited, <i>And such were some of you</i>, &amp;c. that
is, of unclean ye are made holy, and of unjust ye are made just
by the Holy Spirit, for Christ’s Sake, in whom ye have believed.
Of this Signification is that, <i>Rev.</i> xxii. 11. <i>Let him that is just, be just
still</i>; that is, really from just become more just, even as from unjust
he became just. And according to this Signification the <i>Fathers</i>,
and especially <i>Augustine</i>, have interpreted this Word.”
<span class="sidenote">H. Bulling.</span>Thus
far he. <i>H. Bullinger</i>, on the same Place, 1 <i>Cor.</i> vi. speaketh thus; “By
divers Words,” saith he, “the Apostle signifies the same Thing,
when he saith, <i>Ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, In that excellent Saying of the Apostle, so much observed,
<i>Rom.</i> viii. 30. <i>Whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
justified, them he also glorified</i>: This is commonly called the <i>Golden Chain</i>,
as being acknowledged to comprehend the Method and Order of Salvation.
And therefore, if [<i>Justified</i>] were not understood here in its
proper Signification of being <i>made just</i>, Sanctification would be excluded
out of this Chain. And truly it is very worthy of Observation,
that the Apostle, in this succinct and compendious Account,
makes the Word [<i>Justified</i>] to comprehend all betwixt <i>Calling</i> and
<i>Glorifying</i>;
<span class="sidenote">Righteousness<i>, the only Medium by which from our </i>Calling<i> we pass to </i>Glorification.</span>thereby clearly insinuating, that the being really <i>Righteous</i>,
is that only <i>Medium</i> by which from our <i>Calling</i> we pass to <i>Glorification</i>.
Almost all do acknowledge the Word to be so taken in this
Place; and not only so, but most of those who oppose are forced to
acknowledge, that as this is the most proper, so the most common
Signification of it: Thus divers famous <i>Protestants</i> acknowledge.
<span class="sidenote">D. Cham. <i>Tom. 3. de</i> Sanct. <i>L. 10.</i> P. 1.</span>“We are not,” saith <i>D. Chamierus</i>, “such impertinent Esteemers of
Words, as to be ignorant, nor yet such importunate Sophists, as
to deny that the Words <i>Justification</i> and <i>Sanctification</i> do infer one
another; yea, we know that the Saints are chiefly for this Reason
so called, because that in Christ they have received Remission of
Sins: And we read in the Revelations, <i>Let him that is just, be just
still</i>; which cannot be understood, except of the Fruit of inherent
Righteousness. Nor do we deny, but perhaps in other Places they
may be promiscuously taken, especially by the <i>Fathers</i>.”
<span class="sidenote">Beza <i>in C. 3. ad</i> Tit. <i>Ver. 7.</i></span>“I take,”
saith <i>Beza</i>, “the Name of <i>Justification</i> largely, so as it comprehends
whatsoever we acquire from Christ, as well by Imputation, as by
the Efficacy of the Spirit in sanctifying us. So likewise is the
Word <i>Justification</i> taken, <i>Rom.</i> viii. 30.”
<span class="sidenote">Melanct. <i>in Apol. Conf. Aug.</i></span><i>Melancthon</i> saith, “That
to be justified by Faith, signifies in Scripture not only to be pronounced
just, but also of unrighteous to be made righteous.”
Also some chief <i>Protestants</i>, though not so clearly, yet in Part, hinted
at our Doctrine, whereby we ascribe unto the <i>Death of Christ</i> Remission
of Sins, and the Work of Justification unto the <i>Grace of the Spirit</i>
acquired by his Death.
<span class="sidenote">Boræus, <i>in</i> Gen. <i>C. 15</i>. Credidit Abraham. Deo, <i>P. 161</i>.</span><i>Martinus Boræus</i>, explaining that Place of the
Apostle, <i>Rom.</i> iv. 25. <i>Who was given for our Sins, and rose again for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
Justification</i>, saith: “There are two Things beheld in Christ, which
are necessary to our Justification; the one is his Death, the other is
his arising from the Dead. By his Death, the Sins of this World
behoved to be expiated: By his Rising from the Dead, it pleased the
same Goodness of God to give the Holy Spirit, whereby both the
Gospel is believed, and the Righteousness, lost by the Fault of the
first <i>Adam</i>, is restored.” And afterwards he saith; “The Apostle
expresseth both Parts in these Words, <i>Who was given for our Sins</i>, &amp;c.
in his Death is beheld the Satisfaction for Sin; in his Resurrection,
the Gift of the Holy Spirit, by which our Justification is perfected.”
<span class="sidenote"><i>Idem Lib. 3. Reg. Cap. 9. V. 4. P. 681.</i></span>And again, the same Man saith elsewhere; “Both these Kinds of
Righteousness are therefore contained in <i>Justification</i>, neither can
the one be separate from the other. So that in the Definition of
<i>Justification</i>, the Merit of the Blood of Christ is included, both with
the Remission of Sins, and with the Gift of the Holy Spirit of
Justification and Regeneration.”
<span class="sidenote">Bucerus<i>, in </i>Rom. 4.<i> ad Ver. 16.</i></span><i>Martinus Bucerus</i> saith; “Seeing
by one Sin of <i>Adam</i> the World was lost, the Grace of Christ hath
not only abolished that one Sin, and Death which came by it; but
hath together taken away those infinite Sins, and also led into
full Justification as many as are of Christ; so that God now not only
remits unto them <i>Adam</i>’s Sin, and their own, but also gives them
therewith the Spirit of a solid and perfect Righteousness, which
renders us conform unto the Image of the First-begotten.”
<span class="sidenote">Righteousness, <i>a Conformity to the Image of the First-begotten</i>.</span>And
upon these Words [<i>by Jesus Christ</i>] he saith; “We always judge that
the whole Benefit of Christ tends to this, that we might be strong
through the Gift of Righteousness, being rightly and orderly
adorned with all Virtue, that is, restored to the Image of God.”
<span class="sidenote">W. Forbes <i>in Consider. Modest. de </i>Just.<i> Lib. 2. Sect. 8.</i></span>And <i>lastly</i>, <i>William Forbes</i> our Countryman, Bishop of <i>Edinburgh</i>, saith;
“Whensoever the Scripture makes Mention of the Justification before
God, as speaketh <i>Paul</i>, and from him (besides others) <i>Augustine</i>,
it appears that the Word [<i>justify</i>] necessarily signifies not only
to pronounce just in a Law Sense, but also really and inherently
to make just; because that God doth justify a wicked Man other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>wise
than earthly Judges.
<span class="sidenote"><i>How God justifies the Wicked.</i></span>For he, when he justifies a wicked or
unjust Man, doth indeed pronounce him as these also do; but by
pronouncing him just, because his Judgment is according to Truth,
he also makes him really of unjust to become just.” And again,
the same Man, upon the same Occasion, answering the more rigid
<i>Protestants</i>, who say, That <i>God first justifies, and then makes just</i>; he adds:
“But let them have a Care, lest by too great and empty Subtilty,
unknown both to the Scriptures and the Fathers, they lessen and
diminish the Weight and Dignity of so great and divine a Benefit,
so much celebrated in the Scripture, to wit, <i>Justification</i> of the
Wicked. For if to the formal Reason of <i>Justification</i> of the Ungodly
doth not at all belong his <i>Justification</i> (so to speak) <i>i. e.</i> his
being made righteous, then in the Justification of a Sinner, although
he be justified, yet the Stain of Sin is not taken away,
but remains the same in his Soul as before Justification: And so,
notwithstanding the Benefit of Justification, he remains as before,
unjust and a Sinner; and nothing is taken away, but the Guilt
and Obligation to Pain, and the Offence and Enmity of God
through Non-imputation. But both the Scriptures and Fathers
do affirm, That in the <i>Justification</i> of a Sinner, their Sins are not
only remitted, forgiven, covered, not imputed, but also taken
away, blotted out, cleansed, washed, purged, and very far removed
from us, as appears from many Places of the holy Scriptures.”
The same <i>Forbes</i> shews us at length, in the following
Chapter, That this was the confessed Judgment of the <i>Fathers</i>, out
of the Writings of those who hold the contrary Opinion; some
whereof, out of him, I shall note.
<span class="sidenote">Calv. <i>Inst. L. 3. C. 11. Sect. 15</i>.</span>As, first, <i>Calvin</i> saith, “That
the Judgment of <i>Augustine</i>, or at least his Manner of speaking, is
not throughout to be received; who although he took from Man
all Praise of Righteousness, and ascribed all to the Grace of God,
yet he refers Grace to Sanctification, by which we are regenerate
through the Spirit unto Newness of Life.”
<span class="sidenote">Chemnit. <i>in Exam. Conc. Trid. de Just.</i> P. 129.</span><i>Chemnitius</i> saith, “That
they do not deny, but that the Fathers take the Word [<i>justify</i>] for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
<i>renewing</i>, by which Works of Righteousness are wrought in us by
the Spirit.” And P. 130. “I am not ignorant, that the Fathers
indeed often use the Word [<i>justify</i>] in this Signification, to wit, of
<i>making just</i>.”
<span class="sidenote">Zanchius <i>in C. 2. ad</i> Ep. <i>Ver. 4. Loc. de Just</i>. Thes. 13.</span><i>Zanchius</i> saith, “That the Fathers, and chiefly <i>Augustine</i>,
interpret the Word [<i>justify</i>] according to this Signification,
to wit, of <i>making just</i>; so that, according to them, to be
<i>justified</i> was no other than of <i>unjust</i> to be made <i>just</i>, through the
Grace of God for Christ.” He mentioneth more, but this may
suffice to our Purpose.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Asser. I.</span>Having thus sufficiently proved, that by <i>Justification</i> is to

Justification in the Sight of God, is, the <i>Revelation of Jesus Christ in
the Soul</i>,<span class="sidenote">Proof 1.</span>changing, altering, and renewing the Mind, by whom (even
the Author of this inward Work) thus formed and revealed, we are
truly justified and accepted in the Sight of God. For it is as we are
thus covered and clothed with him, in whom the Father is always well
pleased, that we may <i>draw near to God</i>, and stand with Confidence
before his Throne, being purged by the <i>Blood of Jesus</i> inwardly
poured into our Souls, and clothed with his Life and Righteousness
therein revealed. And this is that Order and Method of Salvation
held forth by the Apostle in that divine Saying, <i>Rom.</i> v. 10. <i>For if
when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son;
much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</i> For the Apostle
first holding forth the Reconciliation wrought by the Death of Christ,
wherein God is near to receive and redeem Man, holds forth his
<i>Salvation</i> and <i>Justification</i> to be by the <i>Life of Jesus</i>. Now, that this
<i>Life</i> is an <i>inward, spiritual</i> Thing revealed in the Soul, whereby it is
renewed and brought forth out of <i>Death</i>, where it naturally has been
by the <i>Fall</i>, and so quickened and made alive unto God, the same
Apostle shews, <i>Ephes.</i> ii. 5. <i>Even when we were dead in Sins and Trespasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
he hath quickened us together in Christ (by whose Grace ye are saved) and hath
raised us up together.</i> Now this none will deny to be the inward
Work of Renovation, and therefore the Apostle gives that Reason of
their being <i>saved by Grace</i>; which is the inward Virtue and Power of
Christ in the Soul: But of this Place more hereafter. Of the Revelation
of this <i>inward Life</i> the Apostle also speaketh, 2 <i>Cor.</i> iv. 10.
<i>That the Life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our Bodies</i>; and
Ver. 11. <i>That the Life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
Flesh</i>. Now this inward <i>Life of Jesus</i> is that <i>whereby</i>, as is before observed,
he said, <i>We are saved</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2.</span>Secondly, <i>That it is by this Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the new Creation
in us, that we are justified</i>, doth evidently appear from that excellent
Saying of the Apostle included in the Proposition itself, <i>Tit.</i> iii. 5.
<i>According to his Mercy he hath saved us, by the Washing of Regeneration, and
Renewing of the Holy Ghost</i>, &amp;c. Now that whereby we are saved, that
we are also no Doubt justified by; which Words are in this Respect
synonymous.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The immediate Cause of </i>Justification<i> is the inward Work of </i>Regeneration.</span>Here the Apostle clearly ascribes the <i>immediate</i> Cause
of Justification to this inward Work of Regeneration, which is <i>Jesus
Christ revealed in the Soul</i>, as being that which formally states us in a
Capacity of being reconciled with God; the Washing or Regeneration
being that inward Power and Virtue, whereby the Soul is
cleansed, and clothed with the Righteousness of Christ, so as to be
made fit to appear before God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, This Doctrine is manifest from 2 <i>Cor.</i> xiii. 5. <i>Examine your
own selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your <span class="correction" title="In the original book: ownselves">own selves</span>: Know ye not your
own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</i> First, It
appears here how earnest the Apostle was that they should know
Christ <i>in them</i>; so that he presses this Exhortation upon them, and
inculcates it three Times.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Cause of </i>Reprobation<i> is Christ not known by inward </i>Revelation.</span><i>Secondly</i>, He makes the Cause of Reprobation,
or Not-justification, the Want of Christ thus revealed and
known in the Soul: Whereby it necessarily follows, by the Rule of
<i>Contraries</i>, where the Parity is alike (as in this Case it is evident) that,
where Christ is inwardly known, there the Persons subjected to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
are approved and justified. For there can be nothing more plain
than this, That if we must know Christ <i>in us</i>, except we be Reprobates,
or unjustified Persons; if we know him <i>in us</i>, we are not Reprobates,
and consequently justified ones. Like unto this is that
other Saying of the same Apostle, Gal. iv. 19. <i>My little Children, of
whom I travail in Birth again, until Christ be formed in you</i>; and therefore
the Apostle terms this, <i>Christ within, the Hope of Glory</i>, Col. i. 27, 28.
Now that which is the <i>Hope of Glory</i>, can be no other than that
which we <i>immediately</i> and <i>most nearly</i> rely upon for our Justification,
and that whereby we are really and truly made just. And as we
do not hereby deny, but the original and fundamental Cause of
our Justification is the Love of God manifested in the Appearance
of <i>Jesus Christ</i> in the Flesh,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ by his Death and Sufferings has opened a Way for our Reconciliation.</i></span>who by his Life, Death, Sufferings, and
Obedience, made a Way for our Reconciliation, and became a Sacrifice
for the Remission of Sins that are past, and purchased unto us
this <i>Seed</i> and <i>Grace</i>, from which this Birth arises, and in which Jesus
Christ is inwardly received, formed, and brought forth in us, in
his own pure and holy Image of Righteousness, by which our Souls
live unto God, and are clothed with him, and have put him on,
even as the Scripture speaks, <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 23, 24. <i>Gal.</i> iii. 27. we stand
justified and saved in and by him, and by his Spirit and Grace,
<i>Rom.</i> iii. 24. 1 <i>Cor.</i> vi. 11. <i>Tit.</i> iii. 7. So again, <i>reciprocally</i>, we are
hereby made Partakers of the Fulness of his <i>Merits</i>, and his cleansing
<i>Blood</i> is near, to wash away every Sin and Infirmity, and to heal
all our Backslidings, as often as we turn towards him by unfeigned
Repentance, and become renewed by his Spirit. Those then that
find him thus raised, and ruling in them, have a true Ground of
Hope to believe that they are justified by his Blood. But let not any
deceive themselves, so as to foster themselves in a vain Hope and Confidence,
that by the Death and Sufferings of Christ they are justified,
so long as <i>Sin lies at their Door</i>, Gen. iv. 7. Iniquity prevails, and
they remain yet unrenewed and unregenerate; lest it be said unto
them, <i>I know you not</i>. Let that Saying of Christ be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
<i>Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter, but he that doth the Will of
my Father</i>, Matt. vii. 21. To which let these excellent Sayings of the
beloved Disciple be added; <i>Little Children, let no Man deceive you;
he that doth Righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. He that
committeth Sin is of the Devil; because if our Heart condemn us, God is
greater than our Heart, and knoweth all Things</i>, 1 John iii. 7. &amp; 20.</p>

<p>Many famous Protestants bear Witness to this inward Justification
by Christ inwardly revealed and formed in Man.
<span class="sidenote">Boræus<i> in </i>Gen.<i> P. 162.</i></span>As <i>M. Boræus</i>: “In
the Imputation,” saith he, “wherein Christ is ascribed and imputed
to Believers for Righteousness, the Merit of his Blood, and the
Holy Ghost given unto us by Virtue of his Merits, are equally
included.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Testimonies of famous Protestants of inward Justification</i>.</span>And so it shall be confessed, <i>That Christ is our Righteousness</i>,
as well from his Merit, Satisfaction, and Remission of Sins
obtained by him, as from the Gifts of the Spirit of Righteousness.
And if we do this, we shall consider the whole Christ proposed to
us for our Salvation, and not any single Part of him.” The same
Man, P. 169. “In our justification then Christ is considered, who
breathes and lives in us, to wit, by his Spirit put on by us; concerning
which putting on the Apostle saith, <i>Ye have put on Christ</i>.”
And again, P. 171. “We endeavour to treat in Justification, not of
Part of Christ, but him wholly, in so far as he is our Righteousness
every Way.” And a little after: “As then blessed <i>Paul</i>, in our
Justification, when he saith, <i>Whom he justified, them he glorified</i>, comprehends
all Things which pertain to our being reconciled to
God the Father, and our Renewing, which fits us for attaining
unto Glory, such as Faith, Righteousness, Christ, and the Gift of
Righteousness exhibited by him, whereby we are regenerated, to
the fulfilling of the Justification which the Law requires; so we
also will have all Things comprehended in this Cause, which are
contained in the Recovery of Righteousness and Innocency.” And
P. 181. “The Form,” saith he, “of our Justification is the divine Righteousness
itself, by which we are formed just and good. This is
<i>Jesus Christ</i>, who is esteemed our Righteousness, partly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
Forgiveness of Sins, and partly from the Renewing and the Restoring
of that Integrity, which was lost by the Fault of the first
<i>Adam</i>: So that this new and heavenly <i>Adam</i> being put on by us, of
which the Apostle saith, <i>Ye have put on Christ</i>, ye have put him on,
I say, as the Form, so the Righteousness, Wisdom, and Life of
God.”

<span class="sidenote">R. Baxter.</span>And lastly,

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Posit. 3.</span>The <i>third</i> Thing proposed to be considered is, concerning
<i>the Necessity of good Works to Justification</i>. I suppose there is enough
said before to clear us from any Imputation of being <i>Popish</i> in this
Matter.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if it be queried, <i>Whether we have not said, or will not affirm, that
a Man is justified by Works?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; I hope none need, neither ought to take Offence, if
in this Matter we use the plain Language of the holy Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
which faith expresly in answer hereunto, <i>James</i> ii. 24.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That Works are necessary to Justification.</i></span><i>Ye see then how
that by Works a Man is justified, and not by Faith only.</i> I shall not offer
to prove the Truth of this Saying, since what is said in this Chapter
by the Apostle is sufficient to convince any Man that will read
and believe it; I shall only from this derive this one Argument.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>If no Man can be justified without Faith, and no Faith be living,
nor yet available to Justification without Works, then Works are necessary
to <i>Justification</i>:</p>

<p>But the first is true: Therefore also the last.</p>

<p>For this Truth is so apparent and evident in the Scriptures, that
for the Proof of it we might transcribe most of the Precepts of the
Gospel. I shall instance a few, which of themselves do so clearly
assert the Thing in Question, that they need no Commentary, nor
farther Demonstration. And then I shall answer the Objections
made against this, which indeed are the Arguments used for the contrary
Opinion, <i>Heb.</i> xii. 14. <i>Without Holiness no Man shall see God.</i>
Matt. vii. 21.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Not the Sayers, but the Doers are blessed.</i></span><i>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the Will of my Father which is in
Heaven.</i> John xiii. 7. <i>If ye know these Things, happy are ye if ye do them.</i>
1 Cor. vii. 19. <i>Circumcision is nothing, and Uncircumcision is nothing, but
the Keeping of the Commandments of God.</i> Rev. xxii. 14. <i>Blessed are they
that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and
may enter in through the Gates into the City</i>: And many more that might
be instanced. From all which I thus argue:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Arg.</i></span>If those only can <i>enter into the Kingdom that do the Will of the Father</i>;
if those be accounted only the <i>wise Builders</i> and <i>happy</i> that do the Sayings
of Christ; if no Observations avail, but only the <i>Keeping of the
Commandments</i>; and if they be blessed that <i>do the Commandments</i>, and
thereby have Right to the <i>Tree of Life</i>, and Entrance through the
Gates into the City; then <i>Works</i> are absolutely <i>necessary to Salvation</i>
and <i>Justification</i>:</p>

<p>But the first is true: And <i>therefore</i> also the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The Consequence of the <i>Antecedent</i> is so clear and evident, that I
think no Man of sound Reason will call for a Proof of it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>But they object, <i>That Works are not necessary to Justification</i>:
First, because of that Saying of <i>Christ</i>, Luke xvii. 10.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Unprofitable Servants.</i></span><i>When ye shall
have done all these Things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
Servants.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><i>Answer</i>; As to God we are indeed unprofitable, for he needeth
nothing,
<span class="sidenote"><i>God needeth nothing.</i></span>neither can we add any Thing unto him: But as to ourselves,
we are not unprofitable; else it might be said, that it is not
profitable for a Man to keep <i>God’s Commandments</i>; which is most absurd,
and would contradict Christ’s Doctrine throughout. Doth not Christ,
<i>Matt.</i> v. through all those Beatitudes, pronounce Men blessed for
their <i>Purity</i>, for their <i>Meekness</i>, for their <i>Peaceableness</i>, &amp;c? And is
not then that for which Christ pronounceth Men blessed, profitable
unto them? Moreover, <i>Matt.</i> xxv. 21, 23.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Those that had improved their </i>Talents<i>, were called good and faithful Servants.</i></span>Doth not Christ pronounce
the Men <i>good and faithful Servants</i> that improved their Talents? Was
not their doing of that then profitable unto them? And Ver. 30. it
is said of him that hid his <i>Talent</i>, and did not improve it, <i>Cast ye the
unprofitable Servant into utter Darkness</i>. If then not improving of the
<i>Talent</i> made the Man <i>unprofitable</i>, and he was therefore <i>cast into utter
Darkness</i>, it will follow by the Rule of <i>Contraries</i>, so far at least that
the Improving made the other profitable; seeing, if our Adversaries
will allow us to believe Christ’s Words, this is made a <i>Reason</i>, and
so at least a <i>Cause instrumental</i> of their Acceptance; <i>Well done, good and
faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few Things, I will make thee
Ruler over many Things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object those Sayings of the Apostle, where he excludes
the Deeds of the Law from Justification; as first, <i>Rom.</i> iii. 20.
<i>Because by the Deeds of the Law there shall be no Flesh justified in his Sight.</i>
And Ver. 28. <i>Therefore we conclude, that a Man is justified by Faith,
without the Deeds of the Law.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i>.</span><i>Answ.</i> We have shewn already what Place we give to <i>Works</i>, even
to the <i>best of Works</i>, in <i>Justification</i>; and how we ascribe its immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
and formal Cause to the <i>Worker</i> brought forth in us, but not to the
<i>Works</i>. But in answer to this Objection, I say, there is a great Difference
betwixt the <i>Works</i> of the <i>Law</i>, and those of <i>Grace</i>, or of the
<i>Gospel</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Works of the Gospel or Grace distinguished from those of the Law.</i></span>The first are excluded, the second not, but are necessary.
The first are those which are performed in Man’s own Will, and by
his Strength, in a Conformity to the outward Law and Letter; and
therefore are Man’s own imperfect Works, or Works of the Law,
which <i>makes nothing perfect</i>: And to this belong all the Ceremonies,
Purifications, Washings, and Traditions of the <i>Jews</i>. The second
are the Works of the Spirit of Grace in the Heart, wrought in Conformity
to the inward and spiritual Law; which Works are not
wrought in Man’s Will, nor by his Power and Ability, but in and
by the Power and Spirit of Christ <i>in us</i>, and therefore are <i>pure</i> and
<i>perfect</i> in their Kind (as shall hereafter be proved) and may be
called <i>Christ’s Works</i>, for that he is the immediate Author and Worker
of them: Such <i>Works</i> we affirm absolutely <i>necessary to Justification</i>, so
that a Man cannot be justified without them; and all <i>Faith</i> without
them is dead and useless, as the Apostle <i>James</i> saith. Now, that such
a Distinction is to be admitted, and that the <i>Works</i> excluded by the
Apostle in the Matter of Justification are of the first Kind, will appear,
if we consider the Occasion of the Apostle’s mentioning this,
as well here, as throughout his Epistle to the <i>Galatians</i>, where he
speaks of this Matter and to this Purpose at large: Which was this,
That whereas many of the <i>Gentiles</i> that were not of the Race or Seed
of <i>Abraham</i>, as concerning the Flesh, were come to be converted to
the <i>Christian Faith</i>, and to believe in him, some of those, that were of
the <i>Jewish Proselytes</i>, thought to subject the faithful and believing <i>Gentiles</i>
to the legal Ceremonies and Observations, as necessary to their
Justification:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Occasion of the Apostle’s speaking of the Works of the Law, which are excluded.</i></span>This gave the Apostle <i>Paul</i> Occasion at length, in his
Epistle to the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Galatians</i>, and elsewhere, to shew the Use and
Tendency of the Law, and of its Works, and to contra-distinguish
them from the Faith of Christ, and the Righteousness thereof; shewing
how the former was ceased and become ineffectual, the other re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>maining,
and yet necessary. And that the Works excluded by the
Apostle are of this Kind of Works of the Law, appears by the whole
Strain of his Epistle to the <i>Galatians</i>, Chap. i, ii, iii, and iv. For after,
in Chap. iv. he upbraideth them for their Returning unto the Observation
of <i>Days</i> and <i>Times</i>, and that, in the Beginning of Chap. v.
he sheweth them their Folly, and the evil Consequence of adhering
to the Ceremonies of Circumcision, then he adds, Ver. 6. <i>For in
Christ Jesus neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth, but Faith, which
worketh by Love</i>; and thus he concludes again, Chap. vi. Ver. 15.
<i>For in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth, nor Uncircumcision, but a
new Creature.</i> From which Places appeareth that Distinction of Works
before-mentioned, whereof the one is excluded, the other necessary
to Justification. For the Apostle sheweth here, that <i>Circumcision</i>
(which Word is often used to comprehend the whole Ceremonies
and legal Performances of the <i>Jews</i>) is not necessary, nor doth avail.
Here then are the <i>Works</i> which are excluded, by which <i>no Man is justified</i>;
but <i>Faith</i>, which <i>worketh by Love</i>, but the <i>new Creature</i>, this is
that which <i>availeth</i>, which is <i>absolutely necessary</i>: For <i>Faith</i>, that <i>worketh
by Love</i>, cannot be without <i>Works</i>; for, as it is said in the same
5th Chapter, Ver. 22. <i>Love is a Work of the Spirit</i>; also the <i>new Creature</i>,
if it avail and be necessary, cannot be without Works; seeing
it is natural for it to bring forth Works of Righteousness. Again, that
the Apostle no Ways intends to exclude such good Works appears,
in that in the same Epistle he exhorts the <i>Galatians</i> to them, and holds
forth the Usefulness and Necessity of them, and that very plainly,
Chap. vi. Ver. 7, 8, 9.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Usefulness and Necessity of good</i> Works.</span><i>Be not deceived</i>, saith he, <i>God is not mocked;
for whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall he also reap: For he that soweth to
the Flesh, shall of the Flesh reap Corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit,
shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting. And let us not be weary of Well-doing,
for in due Season we shall reap, if we faint not</i>: Doth it not hereby
appear, how necessary the Apostle would have the <i>Galatians</i> know
that he esteemed good Works to be? To wit, not the outward Ceremonies
and Traditions of the Law, but the Fruits of the Spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
mentioned a little before; by which Spirit he would have them to
be led, and walk in those good Works: As also, how much he ascribed
to these good Works, by which he affirms <i>Life everlasting</i> is
reaped. Now, that cannot be useless to Man’s Justification, which
capacitates him to reap so rich an Harvest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span>But <i>Lastly</i>; For a full Answer to this Objection, and for the establishing
of this Doctrine of <i>good Works</i>, I shall instance another Saying
of the same Apostle <i>Paul</i>, which our Adversaries also in the Blindness
of their Minds make use of against us; to wit, Tit. iii. 5.
<span class="sidenote">Justified<i> not by our </i>legal Performances<i>, but the </i>Fruit<i> of the </i>Spirit.</span><i>Not
by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy
he saved us, by the Washing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy
Ghost.</i> It is generally granted by all, that [<i>saved</i>] is here all one as
if it had been said [<i>justified</i>.] Now there are two Kinds of <i>Works</i> here
mentioned: One by which we are not saved, that is, not justified;
and another by which we are saved, or justified. The first, the Works
of Righteousness which we have wrought, that is, which we in our
first fallen Nature, by our own Strength, have wrought, our own
<i>legal Performances</i>, and therefore may truly and properly be called
ours, whatever specious Appearances they may have. And that it
must needs and ought to be so understood, doth appear from the
other Part, <i>By the Washing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghost</i>;
seeing <i>Regeneration</i> is a Work, comprehensive of many good Works, even
of all those which are called <i>the Fruits of the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj.</span>Now in Case it should be objected, <i>That these may also be called ours,
because wrought in us, and also by us many Times as Instruments</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; It is far otherwise than the former: For in the first we
are yet alive in our own natural State, unrenewed, working of ourselves,
seeking to save ourselves, by imitating and endeavouring a
Conformity to the outward Letter of the Law; and so wrestling and
striving in the <i>Carnal Mind</i>, that is Enmity to God, and in the <i>cursed
Will</i> not yet subdued. But in this second we are <i>crucified with Christ</i>,
we are become <i>dead with him</i>, have <i>partaken of the Fellowship of his Sufferings</i>,
are made <i>conformable to his Death</i>; and our first Man, our <i>old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
Man with all his Deeds</i>, as well the openly Wicked as the seemingly
Righteous, our legal Endeavours and foolish Wrestlings, are all buried
and nailed to the <i>Cross of Christ</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Not </i>We<i>, but </i>Christ in us<i> is the Worker of Righteousness.</i></span>and so it is no more <i>we</i>, but
<i>Christ alive in us</i>, the <i>Worker in us</i>. So that though it be <i>we</i> in a Sense,
yet it is according to that of the Apostle to the same <i>Galatians</i>,
Chap. ii. Ver. 20. <i>I am crucified, yet nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me: Not I, but the Grace of Christ in me</i>. These Works are
especially to be ascribed to the <i>Spirit of Christ</i>, and the <i>Grace of God in
us</i>, as being immediately thereby acted and led in them, and enabled
to perform them. And this Manner of Speech is not strained,
but familiar to the Apostles, as appears, Gal. ii. 8. <i>For he that wrought
effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the Circumcision, the same was mighty
in me</i>, &amp;c. Phil. ii. 13. <i>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and
to do</i>, &amp;c. So that it appears by this Place, that since the <i>Washing of
Regeneration</i> is necessary to Justification, and that <i>Regeneration</i> comprehends
<i>Works</i>, <i>Works</i> are necessary; and that these <i>Works</i> of the
Law that are excluded, are different from these that are necessary
and admitted.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object <i>That no Works, yea, not the Works of Christ
in us, can have Place in Justification, because nothing that is impure can be
useful in it; and all the Works wrought in us are impure</i>. For this they
allege that Saying of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, lxiv. 6. <i>All our Righteousnesses

so must our Works be; which though good in themselves, yet as performed by us,
they receive a Tincture of Impurity, even as clean Water passing through an

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>That no <i>impure Works</i> are useful to Justification, is confessed; but
that all the Works wrought in the Saints are such, is denied. And
for Answer to this, the former Distinction will serve. We confess,
that the first Sort of <i>Works</i> above-mentioned are <i>impure</i>; but not the
second: Because the first are wrought in the unrenewed State, but
not the other. And as for that of <i>Isaiah</i>, it must relate to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>

<span class="sidenote"><i>What Sort of </i>Righteousness<i> is as filthy </i>Rags.</span>for though he saith, <i>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags</i>, yet
that will not comprehend the Righteousness of Christ <i>in us</i>, but only
that which we work <i>of</i> and <i>by</i> ourselves. For should we so conclude,
then it would follow, that we should throw away all <i>Holiness</i> and
<i>Righteousness</i>; since that which is as <i>filthy Rags</i>, and as a <i>menstruous
Garment</i>, ought to be thrown away; yea, it would follow, that all
the Fruits of the Spirit, mentioned, <i>Gal.</i> iv. were as <i>filthy Rags</i>;
Whereas on the Contrary, some of the Works of the Saints are said
to have a <i>sweet Savour in the Nostrils of the Lord</i>; are said to be an <i>Ornament
of great Price in the Sight of God</i>; are said to <i>prevail with him</i>,
and to be <i>acceptable to him</i>; which <i>filthy Rags</i> and a <i>menstruous Garment</i>
cannot be. Yea, many famous <i>Protestants</i> have acknowledged, that
this Place is not therefore so to be understood.
<span class="sidenote">Calvin<i> and others their Sense concerning </i>Isa. 64. 6.<i> of our </i>Righteousness.</span><i>Calvin</i> upon this

concerning all the Righteousness of our Flesh; that Opinion indeed

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XII.</h3> As to the other Part, <i>That seeing the best of Men are still impure
and imperfect, therefore their </i>Works<i> must be so</i>; it is to beg the Question,
and depends upon a Proposition denied; and which is to be discussed
at farther Length in the next Proposition. But though we
should suppose a Man not thoroughly perfect in all Respects, yet
will not that hinder, but good and perfect <i>Works</i> in their Kind may
be brought forth in him by the Spirit of Christ: Neither doth the
Example of <i>Water</i> going through an unclean <i>Pipe</i> hit the Matter;
because though Water may be capable to be tinctured with Uncleanness,
yet the Spirit of God cannot, whom we assert to be the
immediate Author of those <i>Works</i> that avail in <i>Justification</i>: And therefore
Jesus Christ’s Works in his Children are <i>pure</i> and <i>perfect</i>, and he
worketh in and through that <i>pure Thing</i> of his own forming and creating
in them. Moreover, if this did hold, according to our Adversaries
Supposition, <i>That no Man ever was or can be perfect</i>, it would
follow, that the very Miracles and Works of the Apostles, which
Christ wrought in them, and they wrought in and by the Power,
Spirit and Grace of Christ, were also <i>impure</i> and <i>imperfect</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Were the Miracles and Works of the Apostles, wrought by the Power of Christ in them, </i>impure<i> and </i>imperfect<i>?</i></span>such as
their converting of the Nations to the <i>Christian Faith</i>; their gathering
of the <i>Churches</i>, their writing of the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>; yea, and their offering
up and sacrificing of their <i>Lives</i> for the <i>Testimony of Jesus</i>. What
may our Adversaries think of this Argument, whereby it will follow,
that the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>, whose Perfection and Excellency they
seem so much to magnify, are proved to be <i>impure</i> and <i>imperfect</i>, because
they came through <i>impure</i> and <i>imperfect Vessels</i>? It appears by
the Confessions of <i>Protestants</i>, that the <i>Fathers</i> did frequently attribute
unto <i>Works</i> of this Kind that <i>instrumental Work</i>, which we have spoken
of in <i>Justification</i>, albeit some ignorant Persons cry out it is <i>Popery</i>,
and also divers, and that famous <i>Protestants</i>, do of themselves confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
it.
<span class="sidenote">A. Polan.<i> Our Doctrine of </i>Justification<i> and </i>Works<i>, is not Popery.</i></span><i>Amandus Polanus</i>, in his <i>Symphonia Catholica</i>, Cap. 27. <i>de Remissione

most agreeable to the Doctrine of the <i>Fathers</i>: “We obtain
the Remission of Sins by Repentance, Confession, Prayers, and
Tears, proceeding from Faith, but do not <i>merit</i>, to speak properly;
and therefore we obtain Remission of Sins, not by the
<i>Merit</i> of our Repentance and Prayers, but by the Mercy and Goodness
of God.”
<span class="sidenote">Gentiletus <i>Ex Impress.</i> Gen. 1516.</span><i>Innocentius Gentiletus</i>, a Lawyer of great Fame among

having before spoken of <i>Faith</i> and <i>Works</i>, adds these Words:
“But seeing the one cannot be without the other, we call them
both conjunctly <i>instrumental Causes</i>.”
<span class="sidenote">Zanchius.</span><i>Zanchius</i>, in his fifth Book,
<i>De Naturâ Dei</i>, saith; “We do not simply deny, that <i>good Works</i> are
the Cause of <i>Salvation</i>, to wit, the instrumental, rather than the efficient
Cause, which they call [<i>sine quâ non</i>.”] And afterwards,
“Good Works are the instrumental Cause of the Possession of <i>Life
eternal</i>; for by these, as by a Means and a lawful Way, God
leads unto the Possession of <i>Life eternal</i>.”
<span class="sidenote">G. Ames. <i>in Medulla S. Theologiæ</i>, L. 2. C. 1. Thes. 30.</span><i>G. Amesius</i> saith, “That

helping, and advancing towards the Possession of the
Life.”
<span class="sidenote">R. Baxter.</span>Also <i>Richard Baxter</i>, in his Book above-cited, Page 155. saith,
“<i>That we are justified by</i> Works in the same Kind of Causality as by
<i>Faith</i>, to wit, as being both Causes <i>sine quâ non</i>, or Conditions of
the <i>New Covenant</i> on our Part requisite to Justification.” And
P. 195. he saith, “It is needless to teach any Scholar, who hath read
the Writings of <i>Papists</i>, how this Doctrine differs from them.”</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Of the </i>Merit<i> and </i>Reward<i> of </i>Works.</span>But <i>lastly</i>, Because it is fit here to say something of the <i>Merit</i> and
<i>Reward</i> of <i>Works</i>, I shall add something in this Place of our Sense
and Belief concerning that Matter. We are far from thinking or
believing, that Man merits any Thing by his Works from God, all
being of <i>Free Grace</i>; and therefore do we, and always have denied
that <i>Popish</i> Notion of <i>Meritum ex condigno</i>. Nevertheless we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
deny, but that God, out of his Infinite Goodness wherewith he
hath loved Mankind, after he communicates to him his holy <i>Grace</i>
and <i>Spirit</i>, doth, according to his own Will, recompence and reward
the <i>good Works</i> of his Children;
<span class="sidenote"><i>GOD rewards the good </i>Works<i> of his Children.</i></span>and therefore this <i>Merit</i> of
<i>Congruity</i> or <i>Reward</i>, in so far as the Scripture is plain and positive
for it, we may not deny; neither wholly reject the Word, in so far
as the Scripture makes use of it. For the same Greek [Greek: axion: αξιον], which
signifies [<i>Merit</i>] is also in those Places where the <i>Translators</i> express it
<i>Worth</i>, or <i>worthy</i>, as <i>Mat.</i> iii. 8. 1 <i>Thess.</i> ii. 12. 2 <i>Thess.</i> i. 5. 11. Concerning
which <i>R. Baxter</i> saith, in the Book above-cited, P. 8. “But
in a larger Sense, as Promise is an Obligation, and the Thing
promised is said to be Debt, so the Performers of the Conditions
are called <i>Worthy</i>, and that which they perform <i>Merit</i>; although
properly all be of <i>Grace</i>, and not of <i>Debt</i>.” Also those, who are
called the <i>Fathers</i> of the <i>Church</i>, frequently used this Word of <i>Merit</i>,
whose Sayings concerning this Matter I think not needful to insert,
because it is not doubted, but evident, that many <i>Protestants</i> are not
averse from this <i>Word</i>, in the Sense that we use it. The Apology
for the <i>Augustan Confession</i>, Art. 20. hath these Words; “We agree
that <i>Works</i> are truly meritorious, not of Remission of Sins, or Justification;
but they are meritorious of other Rewards corporal
and spiritual, which are indeed as well in this Life, as after this
Life.” And further, “Seeing <i>Works</i> are a certain fulfilling of the
Law, they are rightly said to be meritorious; it is rightly said,
that a Reward is due to them.”</p>

they defend the <i>Popish</i> Doctrine of <i>Merit</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">G. Vossius<i> of the Word </i>Merit.</span><i>G. Vossius</i>, in his <i>Theological Thesis</i> concerning the Merits of <i>good

<p class="chapter-head"><i>In whom this pure and holy </i>Birth<i> is fully brought forth, the Body
of Death and Sin comes to be crucified and removed, and their
Hearts united and subjected to the </i>Truth<i>; so as not to obey any

sinning, where the Mind doth not most diligently and watchfully

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> Since we have placed <i>Justification</i> in the Revelation of <i>Jesus
Christ</i> formed and brought forth in the Heart, there working
his Works of Righteousness, and bringing forth the Fruits of the
Spirit, the Question is, How far he may prevail in us while we are
in this Life, or we over our Souls Enemies, in and by his Strength?
Those that plead for <i>Justification</i> wholly without them, merely by
imputative Righteousness, denying the Necessity of being clothed
with real and inward Righteousness, do consequently affirm,
<span class="sidenote"><i>These are the Words of the </i>Westminster<i> larger </i>Catechism.</span>“That
it is impossible for a Man, even the best of Men, to be free of
Sin in this Life, which, <i>they say</i>, no Man ever was; but on the
contrary, that none can, neither of himself, nor by any Grace
received in this Life (<i>O wicked Saying against the Power of God’s
Grace</i>) keep the Commandments of God perfectly; but that every
Man doth break the Commandments in Thought, Word, and
Deed:” Whence they also affirm, as was a little before observed,
“That the very best Actions of the Saints, their Prayers, their
Worships, are impure and polluted.”
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether it is possible to keep the </i>Commandments of God?</span>We on the contrary, though
we freely acknowledge this of the natural fallen Man, in his first
State, whatever his Profession or Pretence may be, so long as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
unconverted and unregenerate, yet we do believe, that to those in
whom Christ comes to be formed, and the new Man brought forth,<span class="sidenote">Part I.</span>
and born of the incorruptible Seed (as that Birth, and Man in
Union therewith, naturally doth the Will of God) it is possible so
far to keep to it, as not to be found daily Transgressors of the <i>Law
of God</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Controversy <i>stated</i>.</span>And for the more clear <i>Stating of the Controversy</i>, let it be
considered:</div>




<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I. <i>Notional Knowledge.</i></span><i>First</i>, That we place not this Possibility in Man’s own Will
and Capacity, as he is a Man, the Son of fallen <i>Adam</i>, or as he is
in his natural State, however wise or knowing, or however much
endued with a notional and literal Knowledge of Christ, thereby
endeavouring a Conformity to the Letter of the Law, as it is outward.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>The new Birth.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, That we attribute it wholly to Man, as he is born
again, renewed in his Mind, raised by Christ, knowing Christ alive,
reigning and ruling in him, and guiding and leading him by his
Spirit, and revealing in him the Law of the Spirit of Life; which
not only manifests and reproves Sin, but also gives Power to come
out of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">III. <i>Growth in Perfection.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, That by this we understand not such a <i>Perfection</i> as may
not daily admit of a Growth, and consequently mean not as if we
were to be as pure, holy, and perfect as God in his divine Attributes
of Wisdom, Knowledge, and Purity; but only a <i>Perfection</i>
proportionable and answerable to Man’s Measure, whereby we are
kept from transgressing the <i>Law of God</i>, and enabled to answer what
he requires of us;
<span class="sidenote"><i>He that improved his </i>Two Talents<i> was nothing less acceptable than he with the five</i>.</span>even as he that improved his <i>two Talents</i> so as to
make <i>four</i> of them, perfected his Work, and was so accepted of his
Lord as to be called a <i>good and faithful Servant</i>, nothing less than he
that made his <i>five ten</i>. Even as a little Gold is perfect Gold in its
Kind, as well as a great Mass, and a Child hath a perfect Body as
well as a Man, though it daily grow more and more. Thus <i>Christ</i>
is said, <i>Luke</i> ii. 52. to have <i>increased in Wisdom and Stature, and in Favour
with God and Man</i>; though before that Time he had never <i>sinned</i>,
and was no Doubt <i>perfect</i>, in a true and proper Sense.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">IV. <i>Wiles of the Enemy.</i></span><i>Fourthly</i>, Though a Man may witness this for a Season, and therefore
all ought to press after it; yet we do not affirm but those that
have attained it in a Measure may, by the Wiles and Temptations
of the Enemy, fall into Iniquity, and lose it sometimes, if they be
not watchful, and do not diligently attend to <i>that of God</i> in the
Heart. And we doubt not but many good and holy Men, who
have arrived to everlasting Life, have had divers Ebbings and Flowings
of this Kind;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Every Sin weakens a Man in his spiritual Condition, but doth not destroy him altogether.</i></span>for though every Sin weakens a Man in his spiritual
Condition, yet it doth not so as to destroy him altogether, or
render him uncapable of rising again.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">V. <i>Righteousness became natural.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, Though I affirm, that after a Man hath arrived at such a
State, in which he may be able not to sin, yet he may sin: Nevertheless,
I will not affirm that a State is not attainable in this Life, in
which to do <i>Righteousness</i> may be so natural to the regenerate Soul,
that in the Stability of that Condition he cannot sin. Others may
speak more certainly of this State, if they have arrived at it. With
respect to myself, I speak modestly, because I ingenuously confess
that I have not yet attained it; but I cannot deny that there is such
a State, as it seems to be so clearly asserted by the Apostle, 1 <i>John</i>
iii. 9. <i>He that is born of God sinneth not, neither can he, because the Seed
of God remaineth in him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Part II.</span><span class="sidenote">Sect. 1.</span>
The <i>Controversy</i> being thus stated, which will serve to obviate <i>Objections</i>,
I shall proceed, <i>First</i>, to shew the Absurdity of that Doctrine
that pleads for Sin <i>for Term of Life</i>, even in the Saints.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sect. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, To prove this Doctrine of <i>Perfection</i> from many pregnant
Testimonies of the Holy Scripture.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sect. 3.</span>And, <i>Lastly</i>, To answer the Arguments and Objections of our Opposers.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Sect. I.</span><span class="sidenote">Proof 1. <i>The Doctrine of </i>Pleading for Sin for Term of Life<i> absurd.</i></span>
<i>First</i> then, This Doctrine, <i>viz.</i> That the <i>Saints nor can nor
ever will be free of sinning in this Life</i>, is inconsistent with the Wisdom
of God, and with his glorious Power and Majesty, <i>who is of purer
Eyes than to behold Iniquity</i><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; who having purposed in himself to gather
to him that should worship him, and be Witnesses for him on Earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
a <i>chosen People</i>, doth also no Doubt sanctify and purify them. For God
hath no Delight in Iniquity, but abhors Transgression; and though
he regard Man in Transgression so far as to pity him, and afford
him Means to come out of it; yet he loves him not, neither delights
in him, as he is joined thereunto. Wherefore if Man must be always
joined to Sin, then God would always be at a Distance with
him; as it is written, <i>Isa.</i> lix. 2. <i>Your Iniquities have separated between
you and your God, and your Sins have hid his Face from you</i>; whereas on
the contrary, the <i>Saints</i> are said to <i>partake</i>, even while here, <i>of the
divine Nature</i>, 1 Pet. i. 4. and to be <i>one Spirit with the Lord</i>, 1 Cor. vi. 17.
Now no unclean Thing can be so. It is expresly written, <i>That there
is no Communion betwixt Light and Darkness</i>, 2 Cor. vi. 14. But <i>God</i>
is <i>Light</i>, and <i>every Sin is Darkness</i> in a Measure:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Hath </i>God’s Wisdom<i> been wanting to prepare a </i>Means<i> to serve and worship him </i>perfectly<i>?</i></span>What greater <i>Stain</i>
then can there be than this upon <i>God’s Wisdom</i>, as if he had been
wanting to prepare a Means whereby his Children might perfectly
serve and worship him, or had not provided a Way whereby they
might serve him in any Thing, but that they must withal still serve
the Devil no less, yea, more than himself? For <i>he that sinneth is the
Servant of Sin</i>, Rom. vi. 16. and every Sin is an Act of Service and
Obedience to the Devil. So then if the Saints sin daily in <i>Thought</i>,
<i>Word</i>, and <i>Deed</i>, yea, if the very <i>Service</i> they offer to God be Sin,
surely they serve the Devil more than they do God: For besides that
they give the Devil many intire Services, without Mixture of the
least Grain to God, they give God not the least Service in which the
Devil hath not a large Share: And if their Prayers and all their
spiritual Performances be sinful, the Devil is as much served by
them in these as God, and in most of them much more, since they
confess that many of them are performed without the Leadings and
Influence of God’s Spirit. Now who would not account him a
foolish Master among Men, who being able to do it, and also desirous
it might be so, yet would not provide a Way whereby his
Children and Servants might serve him more intirely than his avowed
Enemy, or would not guard against their serving of him, but be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
so imprudent and unadvised in his Contrivance, that whatever Way
his Servants and Children served him, they should no less, yea, often
much more, serve his Enemy? What may we then think of that
Doctrine that would infer this Folly upon the <i>Omnipotent</i> and <i>Only
Wise God</i>?</div>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 2. <i>Its Inconsistency with the </i>Justice of<i> God.</i></span>Secondly, <i>It is inconsistent with the Justice of God</i>. For since
he requires Purity from his Children, and commands them to abstain
from every Iniquity, so frequently and precisely as shall hereafter
appear, and since his <i>Wrath is revealed against all Ungodliness and
Unrighteousness of Men</i>, it must needs follow, that he hath capacitated
Man to answer his Will, or else that he requires more than he has
given Power to perform; which is to declare him openly <i>unjust</i>, and
with the slothful Servant to be an <i>hard Master</i>. We have elsewhere
spoken of the <i>Injustice</i> these Men ascribe to God, in making him to
<i>damn the Wicked</i>, <i>to whom</i> they allege <i>he never afforded any Means of being
good</i>; but this is yet an Aggravation more irrational and inconsistent,
to say, <i>That God will not afford to those, whom he hath chosen to be his
own </i>(whom they confess he loveth)<i> the Means to please him</i>. What can
follow then from so strange a Doctrine?</div>

<p>This <i>Imperfection</i> in the Saints either proceeds from God or from
themselves: If it proceeds from them, it must be because they are
short in improving or making use of the Power given them, whereby
they are capable to obey; and so it is a Thing possible to them,
as indeed it is by the Help of that Power: But this our Adversaries
deny: They are then not to be blamed for their Imperfection and
continuing in Sin, since it is not possible for them to do otherwise.
If it be not of themselves, it must be of God, who hath not seen
meet to allow them Grace in that Degree to produce that Effect:
And what is this but to attribute to God the Height of Injustice, to
make him require his Children to forsake Sin, and yet not to
afford them sufficient Means for so doing?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Who will give their Children a Stone instead of Bread?</i></span>Surely this makes God
more unrighteous than wicked Men, <i>who if</i> (as Christ saith) <i>their
Children require Bread of them, will not give them a Stone; or instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
Fish, a Serpent</i>. But these Men confess we ought to seek of God
Power to redeem us from Sin, and yet believe they are never to receive
such a Power; such Prayers then cannot be in Faith, but are
all vain. Is not this to make God as unjust to his Children as <i>Pharaoh</i>
was to the <i>Israelites</i>, in requiring Brick and not giving them
Straw? But blessed be God, he deals not so with those that truly
trust in him, and wait upon him, as these Men vainly imagine; for
such faithful Ones find of a Truth that <i>his Grace is sufficient for them</i>,
and know how by his Power and Spirit to overcome the evil
One.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 3. <i>The great and principal End of Christ’s Coming and Appearance was for the Removing of </i>Sin<i>, and to redeem us from all </i>Iniquity.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, This evil Doctrine is <i>highly injurious to Jesus Christ, and
greatly derogates from the Power and Virtue of his Sacrifice, and renders his
Coming and Ministry</i>, as to the great End of it, <i>ineffectual</i>. For Christ,
as for other Ends, so principally he appeared for the Removing of
Sin, for the gathering a righteous Generation, that might serve the
Lord in Purity of Mind, and walk before him in Fear, and to bring
in everlasting Righteousness, and that evangelical Perfection which
the Law could not do. Hence he is said, <i>Tit.</i> ii. 14. <i>to have given
himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himself
a peculiar People, zealous of good Works</i>. This is certainly spoken
of the Saints while upon Earth; but, contrary thereunto, these Men
affirm, That <i>we are never redeemed from all Iniquity</i>, and so make Christ’s
giving of himself for us void and ineffectual, and give the Apostle
<i>Paul</i> the Lie plainly, by denying that <i>Christ purifieth to himself a peculiar
People, zealous of good Works</i>. How are they <i>zealous of good Works</i>,
who are ever committing evil ones? How are they a <i>purified People</i>,
that are still in Impurity, as they are that daily Sin, unless Sin be
accounted no Impurity? Moreover it is said expresly, 1 <i>John</i> iii. 5. 8.
That <i>for this Purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy
the Works of the Devil; and ye know that he was manifested to take away our
Sins</i>. But these Men make this Purpose of none Effect; for they will
not have the Son of God to <i>destroy the Works of the Devil in his Children</i>
in this World, neither will they at all believe that he was manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
to take away our Sins, seeing they plead a Necessity of always living
in them. And lest any should wrest this Place of the Apostle, as if
it were spoken only of taking away the Guilt of Sin, as if it related
not to this Life, the Apostle, as if of Purpose to obviate such an Objection,
adds in the following Verses, <i>Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth
not</i>, &amp;c. I hope then they sin not daily in Thought, Word, and
Deed. <i>Let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteousness, is righteous,
even as he is righteous; he that committeth Sin, is of the Devil</i>; but he that
sinneth daily in Thought, Word, and Deed, committeth Sin; how
comes such an one then to be the Child of God? And if Christ was
manifest to take away Sin, how strangely do they overturn the
Doctrine of Christ who deny that it is ever taken away here? And
how injurious are they to the Efficacy and Power of Christ’s Appearance?
Came not Christ to gather a People out of Sin into Righteousness;
from the Kingdom of Satan into the <i>Kingdom of the dear
Son of God</i>? And are not they that are thus gathered by him his
Servants, his Children, his Brethren, his Friends? <i>who as he was, so
are they to be in this World, holy, pure, and undefiled</i>. And doth not
Christ still watch over them, stand by them, pray for them, and
preserve them by his Power and Spirit, walk in them, and dwell
among them;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Devil dwells among the </i>Reprobates.</span>even as the Devil, on the other Hand, doth among the
reprobate ones? How comes it then that the Servants of Christ are
less his Servants than the Devil’s are his? Or is Christ unwilling to
have his Servants throughly pure? Which were gross Blasphemy to
assert, contrary to many Scriptures. Or is he not able by his
Power to preserve and enable his Children to serve him? Which
were no less blasphemous to affirm of him, concerning whom the
Scriptures declare, That he has <i>overcome Sin, Death, Hell, and the
Grave, and triumphed over them openly, and that all Power in Heaven and
Earth is given to him</i>. But certainly if the Saints sin daily in Thought,
Word, and Deed, as these Men assert, they serve the Devil daily, and
are subject to his Power; and so he prevails more than Christ doth,
and holds the Servants of Christ in Bondage, whether Christ will or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
not. But how greatly then doth it contradict the End of Christ’s
Coming? as it is expressed by the Apostle, <i>Ephes.</i> v. 25, 26, 27. <i>Even
as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify
and cleanse it with the Washing of Water by the Word: That he might present
it to himself a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle</i>, or any such
Thing, <i>but that it should be holy, and without Blemish</i>. Now if Christ
hath really thus answered the Thing he came for, then the Members
of this Church are not always sinning in Thought, Word, and
Deed, or there is no Difference betwixt being sanctified and unsanctified,
clean and unclean, holy and unholy, being daily blemished
with Sin, and being without Blemish.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 4.</span><span class="sidenote">Pastors, Teachers<i>, and </i>Scriptures<i> are given for perfecting of the Saints.</i></span>
Fourthly, This Doctrine renders <i>the Work of the Ministry</i>, <i>the
Preaching of the Word</i>, <i>the Writing of the Scripture</i>, <i>and the Prayers of holy
Men</i>, <i>altogether useless and ineffectual</i>. As to the first, <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 11. <i>Pastors</i>
and <i>Teachers</i> are said to be <i>given for the Perfection of the Saints</i>, &amp;c. <i>until
we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect Man, unto a Measure of the Stature of the Fulness
of Christ</i>. Now if there be a Necessity of sinning daily, and in all
Things, then there can be no Perfection; for such as do so cannot
be esteemed perfect. And if for effectuating this Perfection in
the Saints the Ministry be appointed and disposed of God, do not
such as deny the Possibility hereof render the Ministry useless and of
no Profit? Seeing there can be no other true Use assigned, but to
lead People out of Sin into Righteousness. If so be these Ministers
assure us that we need never expect to be delivered from it, do not
they render their own Work needless? What needs Preaching against
Sin, for the reproving of which all <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Peaching">Preaching</span> is, if it can never be
forsaken? Our Adversaries are Exalters of the Scriptures in Words,
much crying up their Usefulness and Perfection: Now the Apostle
tells us, 2 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 17. That the <i>Scriptures are for making the Man of
God perfect</i>; and if this be denied to be attainable in this Life, then
the Scriptures are of no Profit; for in the other Life we shall not
have use for them. It renders the Prayers of the Saints altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
useless, seeing themselves do confess they ought to pray daily <i>that
God would deliver them from Evil, and free them from Sin, by the Help of
his Spirit and Grace, while in this World</i>. But though we might suppose
this Absurdity to follow, <i>that their Prayers are without Faith</i>, yet were
not that so much, if it did not infer the like upon the holy Apostles,
who prayed earnestly for this End, and therefore no Doubt believed
it attainable, <i>Col.</i> iv. 12. <i>Labouring fervently for you in Prayers, that ye
may stand perfect</i>, &amp;c. 1 Thess. iii. 13. and v. 23, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 5.</span><span class="sidenote">Darkness<i> and </i>Light, Sin<i> and </i>Righteousness<i>, inconsistent together.</i></span>
But <i>Fifthly</i>, This Doctrine is <i>contrary to common Reason and
Sense</i>. For the two opposite <i>Principles</i>, whereof the one rules in the
Children of <i>Darkness</i>, the other in the Children of <i>Light</i>, are <i>Sin</i> and
<i>Righteousness</i>; and as they are respectively leavened and actuated by
them, so they are accounted either as reprobated or justified, seeing
it is <a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><i>Abomination in the Sight of God, either to justify the Wicked, or condemn
the Just</i>. Now to say that Men cannot be so leavened by the one as
to be delivered from the other, is in plain Words to affirm, that <i>Sin</i>
and <i>Righteousness</i> are consistent; and that a Man may be truly termed
<i>righteous</i>, though he be daily <i>sinning</i> in every Thing he doth; and
then what Difference betwixt <i>Good</i> and <i>Evil</i>? Is not this to fall into
that great Abomination of putting <i>Light</i> for <i>Darkness</i>? and calling
<i>Good Evil</i>, and <i>Evil Good</i>? Since they say <i>the very best Actions of God’s
Children are defiled and polluted, and that those that sin daily in Thought,
Word, and Deed are good Men and Women, the Saints and holy Servants of
the holy pure God</i>. Can there be any Thing more repugnant than this
to common Reason? Since the <i>Subject</i> is still denominated from that
<i>Accident</i> that doth most influence it; as a Wall is called <i>White</i> when
there is much <i>Whiteness</i>, and <i>Black</i> when there is much <i>Blackness</i>, and
such like; but when there is more Unrighteousness in a Man than
Righteousness, that Man ought rather to be denominated unrighteous
than righteous.
<span class="sidenote"><i>If all </i>daily sin<i>, where is the </i>righteous Man<i> then spoken of in Scripture?</i></span>Then surely if every Man sin daily in Thought,
Word, and Deed, and that in his Sins there is no Righteousness at
all, and that all his righteous Actions are polluted and mixed with
Sin, then there is in every Man more Unrighteousness than Righte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>ousness;
and so no Man ought to be called <i>righteous</i>, no Man can be
said to be <i>sanctified</i> or <i>washed</i>. <i>Where are then the Children of God? Where
are the purified Ones? Where are they who were sometimes unholy, but now
holy; that sometimes were Darkness, but now are Light in the Lord?</i> There
can none such be found then at this Rate, except that Unrighteousness
be esteemed so: And is not this to fall into that Abomination
above-mentioned of <i>justifying the Ungodly</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Blasphemy of the </i>Ranters<i> or </i>Libertines.</span>This certainly lands in that
horrid Blasphemy of the <i>Ranters</i>, that affirm <i>there is no Difference betwixt
Good and Evil, and that all is one in the Sight of God</i>. I could shew
many more gross Absurdities, evil Consequences, and manifest Contradictions
implied in this <i>sinful Doctrine</i>; but this may suffice at present,
by which also in a good Measure the Proof of the Truth we
affirm is advanced. Yet nevertheless, for the further evidencing of
it, I shall proceed to the second Thing proposed by me, to wit, to
prove this from several Testimonies of the Holy Scriptures.</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Prov. 17. 15.</p></div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Sect. II.</span><span class="sidenote">Proof 1.</span>
And <i>First</i>, I prove it from the peremptory positive Command
of <i>Christ</i> and the <i>Apostles</i>, seeing this is a Maxim engraven in
every Man’s Heart naturally, <i>That no Man is bound to do that which is
impossible</i>: Since then <i>Christ</i> and his <i>Apostles</i> have commanded us to
keep all the <i>Commandments</i>, and to be perfect in this Respect, it is possible
for us so to do.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Be ye perfect, </i>&amp;c.<i> Keep my Commandments.</i></span>Now that this is thus commanded without any
Commentary or Consequence, is evidently apparent from these plain
Testimonies, <i>Matt.</i> v. 48, and vii. 21. <i>John</i> xiii. 17. 1 <i>Cor.</i> vii. 19.
2 <i>Cor.</i> xiii. 11. 1 <i>John</i> ii. 3, 4, 5, 6. and iii. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
These Scriptures intimate a positive Command for it; they declare
the absolute Necessity of it; and therefore, as if they had purposely
been written to answer the Objections of our <i>Opposers</i>, they shew the
Folly of those that will esteem themselves <i>Children</i> or <i>Friends</i> of <i>God</i>,
while they do otherwise.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Possibility of it.</i></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, It is possible, because we receive the Gospel and Law
thereof for that Effect; and it is expresly promised to us, as we are
under Grace, as appears by these Scriptures, <i>Rom.</i> iv. 14. <i>Sin shall
not have Dominion over you; for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
And <i>Rom.</i> viii. 3. <i>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak
through the Flesh, God sending his own Son</i>, &amp;c. <i>that the Righteousness of the
Law might be fulfilled in us</i>, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Difference of the</i> Law <i>and</i> Gospel.</span>For if this were not a Condition both
requisite, necessary, and attainable under the Gospel, there were no
Difference betwixt the <i>Bringing in of a better Hope</i>, and the <i>Law which
made nothing perfect</i>; neither betwixt those which are under the <i>Gospel</i>,
or who under the <i>Law</i> enjoyed and walked in the Life of the Gospel
and mere <i>Legalists</i>. Whereas the Apostle, throughout the whole <i>Sixth</i> to
the <i>Romans</i>, argues not only the <i>Possibility</i> but the <i>Necessity</i> of being
free from Sin, from their being under the <i>Gospel</i>, and under <i>Grace</i>,
and not under the <i>Law</i>; and therefore states himself and those to
whom he wrote in that Condition in these <i>Verses</i>, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and
therefore in the 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 <i>Verses</i>, he argues both the Possibility
and Necessity of this <i>Freedom from Sin</i> almost in the same Manner
we did a little before; and in the 22d he declares them in Measure
to have attained this Condition in these Words, <i>But now being made
free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye have your Fruit unto Holiness,
and the End everlasting Life</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Perfection<i> and </i>Freedom<i> from </i>Sin<i> attained and made possible by the Gospel.</i></span>And as this Perfection or Freedom from
Sin is attained and made possible where the Gospel and inward Law
of the Spirit is received and known, so the Ignorance hereof has been
and is an Occasion of opposing this Truth. For Man not minding
the <i>Light</i> or <i>Law within his Heart</i>, which not only discovers Sin, but
leads out of it, and so being a Stranger to the new Life and Birth
that is born of God, which naturally does his Will, and cannot of
its own Nature transgress the Commandments of God, doth, I say,
in his natural State look at the Commandments as they are without
him in the Letter;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Letter </i>kills<i>, and maketh not </i>alive.</span>and finding himself reproved and convicted, is
by the Letter killed, but not made alive. So Man, finding himself
wounded, and not applying himself inwardly to that which can heal,
labours in his own Will after a Conformity to the Law as it is without
him, which he can never obtain, but finds the more he wrestles,
the more he falleth short. So this is the <i>Jew</i> still in Effect, with his
carnal Commandment, with the <i>Law</i> without, in the <i>first Covenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
State</i>, which <i>makes not the Comers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the Conscience</i>,
Heb. ix. 9. though they may have here a Notion of <i>Christianity</i>,
and an external Faith in <i>Christ</i>. This has made them strain and
wrest the Scriptures for an <i>imputative Righteousness</i> wholly without
them, to cover their Impurities; and this hath made them imagine
an Acceptance with God possible, though they suppose it impossible
ever to obey Christ’s Commands. But alas! O deceived Souls! that
will not avail in the Day wherein <i>God will judge every Man according
to his Work, whether good or bad</i>. It will not save thee to say, it was
necessary for thee to sin daily in Thought, Word, and Deed; for
such as do so have certainly obeyed Unrighteousness: And what is
provided for such but <i>Tribulation and Anguish</i>, <i>Indignation and Wrath</i>;
even as <i>Glory, Honour, and Peace, Immortality and eternal Life to such as
have done Good, and patiently continued in Well-doing</i>. So then, if thou
desirest to know this Perfection and Freedom from Sin possible for
thee, turn thy Mind to the <i>Light and spiritual Law of Christ in the Heart</i>,
and suffer the Reproofs thereof; bear the Judgment and Indignation
of God upon the unrighteous Part in thee as therein is revealed, which
Christ hath made tolerable for thee, and so suffer <i>Judgment in thee</i> to
be <i>brought forth into Victory</i>, and thus come to partake of the <i>Fellowship</i>
of <i>Christ’s Sufferings</i>, and be made <i>conformable unto his Death</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>How we partake of Christ’s Sufferings, and are made conformable unto his Death.</i></span>that thou
mayest feel thyself <i>crucified with him to the</i> World <i>by the Power of his
Cross in thee</i>; so that that Life that sometimes was alive in thee to this
World, and the Love and Lusts thereof, may die, and a new Life
be raised, by which thou mayest live henceforward to God, and not
to or for thyself; and with the Apostle thou mayest say, <i>Gal.</i> ii. 20.
<i>It is no more I, but Christ alive in me</i>; and then thou wilt be a <i>Christian
indeed</i>, and not in <i>Name</i> only, as too many are; then thou wilt know
what it is to have <i>put off the old Man with his Deeds</i>, who indeed sins
daily in Thought, Word, and Deed; and to have <i>put on the new Man,
that it renewed in Holiness, after the Image of him that hath created him</i>, Ephes.
iv. 24. and thou wilt witness thyself to be <a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a><i>God’s Workmanship, created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
in Christ Jesus unto good Works</i>, and so not to sin always. And to
this new Man <i>Christ’s Yoke is easy, and his Burden is light</i>; though it be
heavy to the <i>old Adam</i>; yea, the <i>Commandments of God</i> are not unto
this Man <i>grievous</i>; for it is his <i>Meat and Drink</i> to be found <i>fulfilling the
Will of God</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> Matt. xi. 30. 1 John v. 3.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 3.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Many have attained Perfection.</i></span>
<i>Lastly</i>, This Perfection or Freedom from Sin is possible, because
many have attained it, according to the express Testimony of the
Scripture; some before the Law, and some under the Law, through
witnessing and partaking of the Benefit and Effect of the Gospel,
and much more many under the Gospel.
<span class="sidenote">Enoch <i>walked with God, and was</i> perfect.</span>As <i>first</i>, It is written of
<i>Enoch</i>, <i>Gen.</i> v. 22, 24. that he <i>walked with God</i>, which no Man while
sinning can; nor doth the Scripture record any Failing of his. It
is said of <i>Noah</i>, <i>Gen.</i> vi. 9. and of <i>Job</i> i. 8. and of <i>Zacharias</i> and
<i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>Luke</i> i. 6. that <i>they were perfect</i>; but under the Gospel, besides
that of the <i>Romans</i> above-mentioned, see what the Apostle saith of
many Saints in general, <i>Ephes.</i> ii. 4, 5, 6. <i>But God, who is rich in Mercy, for
his great Love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in Sins,
hath quickened us together with Christ, by Grace ye are saved; and hath raised
us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly Places in Christ Jesus</i> &amp;c.
I judge while they were sitting in these <i>heavenly Places</i>, they could
not be daily sinning in Thought, Word, and Deed; neither were all
their Works which they did there as <i>filthy Rags</i>, or as a <i>menstruous
Garment</i>. See what is further said to the <i>Hebrews</i>, xii. 22, 23. <i>Spirits
of just Men made perfect</i>. And to conclude, let that of the <i>Revelations</i>,
xiv. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. be considered, where though their being <i>found without
Fault</i> be spoken in the present Time, yet it is not without Respect
to their Innocency while upon Earth; and their being <i>redeemed
from among Men, and no Guile found in their Mouth</i>, is expresly
mentioned in the Time past.
<span class="sidenote">Sect III.</span>But I shall proceed now, in the <i>Third
Place</i>, to answer the <i>Objections</i>, which indeed are the Arguments of
our Opposers.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>I shall begin with their chief and great Argument, which
is the Words of the Apostle, 1 John i. 8. <i>If we say that we have no Sin</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
<i>we deceive ourselves, and the Truth is not in us</i>. This they think invincible.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>But is it not strange to see Men so blinded with Partiality? How
many Scriptures tenfold more plain do they reject, and yet stick so
tenaciously to this, that can receive so many Answers? As First,
[<i>If we say we have no Sin</i>, &amp;c.] will not import the Apostle himself to
be included.
<span class="sidenote"><i>If we say we have no Sin</i>, &amp;c. objected.</span>Sometimes the Scripture useth this Manner of Expression
when the Person speaking cannot be included; which Manner
of Speech the <i>Grammarians</i> call <i>Metaschematismus</i>. Thus <i>James</i> iii. 9, 10.
speaking of the <i>Tongue</i>, saith, <i>Therewith bless we God, and therewith
curse we Men</i>; adding, <i>These Things ought not so to be</i>. Who from this
will conclude that the Apostle was one of those Cursers?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span>But <i>Secondly</i>,
This Objection hitteth not the Matter; he saith not, <i>We sin
daily in Thought, Word, and Deed</i>; far less that the <i>very good Works which
God works in us by his Spirit are Sin</i>: Yea, the very next Verse clearly
shews, that upon <i>Confession</i> and <i>Repentance</i> we are not only <i>forgiven</i>,
but also <i>cleansed</i>; <i>He is faithful to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanse us
from all Unrighteousness</i>. Here is both a Forgiveness and Removing of
the Guilt, and a Cleansing or Removing of the Filth; for to make
<i>Forgiveness</i> and <i>Cleansing</i> to belong both to the Removing of the <i>Guilt</i>,
as there is no Reason for it from the Text, so it were a most violent
forcing of the Words, and would imply a needless Tautology. The
Apostle having shewn how that not the Guilt only, but even the
Filth also of Sin is removed, subsumes his Words in the Time past in
the 10th Verse, <i>If we say we have not sinned, we make him a Liar</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 3.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>,
As <i>Augustine</i> well observed, in his Exposition upon the Epistle to the
<i>Galatians</i>, <i>It is one Thing not to sin, and another Thing not to have Sin</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>It is one Thing</i>, not to sin, <i>and another Thing</i> not to have Sin.</span>The Apostle’s Words are not, <i>If we say we sin not, or commit not Sin
daily, </i>but<i> if we say we have no Sin</i>: And betwixt these two there is a
manifest Difference; for in respect all have <i>sinned</i>, as we freely acknowledge,
all may be said in a Sense to have <i>Sin</i>. Again, <i>Sin</i> may
be taken for the <i>Seed of Sin</i>, which may be in those that are redeemed
from <i>actual Sinning</i>; but as to the Temptations and Provocations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
proceeding from it being resisted by the Servants of God, and not
yielded to, they are the Devil’s Sin that tempteth, not the Man’s
that is preserved.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 4.</i></span><i>Fourthly</i>, This being considered, as also how positive
and plain once and again the same Apostle is in that very
Epistle, as in divers Places above cited, is it equal or rational to
strain this one Place, presently after so qualified and subsumed in
the <i>Time past</i>, to contradict not only other positive Expressions of his,
but the whole Tendency of his Epistle, and of the rest of the holy
Commands and Precepts of the Scripture?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, Their second Objection is from two Places of Scripture,
much of one Signification: The one is, 1 <i>Kings</i> viii. 46. <i>For there is
no Man that sinneth not</i>. The other is, <i>Eccles.</i> vii. 20. <i>For there is not
a just Man upon Earth, that doeth Good, and sinneth not</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, <i>First</i>, These affirm nothing of a daily and continual
<i>Sinning</i>, so as never to be redeemed from it; but only that all have
<i>sinned</i>, or that there is none that doth not <i>sin</i>, though not always, so
as never to cease to <i>sin</i>; and in this lies the Question. Yea, in that
Place of the <i>Kings</i> he speaks within two Verses of the returning of
such <i>with all their Souls and Hearts</i>; which implies a Possibility of leaving
off Sin.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Diversity of Seasons and Dispensations</i> respected.</span><i>Secondly</i>, There is a Respect to be had to the Seasons
and Dispensations; for if it should be granted that in <i>Solomon</i>’s Time
there were none that <i>sinned not</i>, it will not follow that there are none
such now, or that it is a Thing not now attainable by the Grace of
God under the Gospel: For <i>A non esse ad non posse non valet sequela</i>.
And <i>Lastly</i>, This whole Objection hangs upon a false Interpretation;
for the Hebrew Word [Hebrew: ycht': יחטא] may be read in the <i>Potential Mood</i>, thus,
<i>There is no Man who may not sin</i>, as well as in the <i>Indicative</i>: So both the
old Latin, <i>Junius</i> and <i>Tremellius</i>, and <i>Vatablus</i> have it; and the same
Word is so used, <i>Psalm</i> cxix. 11. <i>I have hid thy Word in my Heart</i>,
[Hebrew: lt'z l' 'cht' lk: לטעז לא אחטא לך׃] that is to say, <i>That I may not sin against thee</i>, in the
<i>Potential Mood</i>, and not in the <i>Indicative</i>; which being more answerable
to the universal Scope of the Scriptures, the Testimony of the Truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
and the Sense almost of all Interpreters, doubtless ought to be so
understood, and the other <i>Interpretation</i> rejected as <i>spurious</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object some Expressions of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, Rom.
viii. 19. <i>For the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would
not, that I do</i>. And Ver. 24. <i>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver
me from the Body of this Death?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, This Place infers nothing, unless it were apparent that
the Apostle here were speaking of his own Condition, and not rather
in the Person of others, or what he himself had sometimes
borne; which is frequent in Scripture, as in the Case of cursing, in
<i>James</i> before mentioned. But there is nothing in the Text that
doth clearly signify the Apostle to be speaking of himself, or of a
Condition he was then under, or was always to be under; yea, on
the Contrary, in the former Chapter, as afore is at large shewn, he
declares, they were <i>dead to Sin</i>; demanding <i>how such should yet live
any longer therein</i>?
<span class="sidenote">Paul<i> personates the </i>Wretched Man<i>, to shew them the </i>Redeemer.</span><i>Secondly</i>, It appears that the Apostle personated one
not yet come to a spiritual Condition, in that he saith, Ver. 14.
<i>But I am carnal, sold under Sin.</i> Now is it to be imagined, that the
Apostle <i>Paul</i>, as to his own proper Condition, when he wrote that
<i>Epistle</i>, was a <i>carnal Man</i>, who in <i>Chap.</i> i. testifies of himself, That
he was <i>separated to be an Apostle, capable to impart to the </i>Romans<i> spiritual
Gifts</i>; and Chap. viii. Ver. 2. That <i>the Law of the Spirit of Life in
Christ Jesus had made him free from the Law of Sin and Death</i>? So then
he was not <i>carnal</i>. And seeing there are spiritual Men in this Life,
as our Adversaries will not deny, and is intimated through the
whole viiith Chapter to the <i>Romans</i>, it will not be denied but the
Apostle was one of them: So then as his calling himself <i>carnal</i> in
Chap. vii. cannot be understood of his own proper State, neither can
the rest of what he speaks there of that Kind be so understood: Yea
after, Ver. 24. where he makes that Exclamation, he adds in the
next Verse, <i>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>; signifying that
by him he witnessed Deliverance; and so goeth on, shewing how
he had obtained it in the next Chapter, <i>viz.</i> viii. Ver. 35. <i>Who shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
separate us from the Love of Christ?</i> And Ver. 37. <i>But in all these Things
we are more than Conquerors</i>: And in the last Verse, <i>Nothing shall be able
to separate us</i>, &amp;c. But wherever there is a continuing in Sin, there is
a Separation in some Degree, seeing every <i>Sin is contrary to God</i>,
and [Greek: anomia: ανομια], i. e. <i>a Transgression of the Law</i>, 1 John iii. 4.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whom Sin has conquered, he is no Conqueror.</i></span>and whoever
committeth the least Sin, is overcome of it, and so in that
Respect is not a Conqueror, but conquered. This Condition
then, which the Apostle plainly testified he with some others had
obtained, could not consist with continual remaining and abiding
in Sin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They object the <i>Faults and Sins of several eminent Saints, as
</i>Noah<i>, </i>David<i>, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, That doth not at all prove the Case: For the Question is
not, <i>Whether good Men may not fall into Sin</i>, which is not denied; but
<i>whether it be not possible for them not to sin</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Can they that </i>sin<i>, be never freed from </i>Sin.</span>It will not follow because
these Men <i>sinned</i>, that therefore they were never <i>free of Sin</i>, but always
<i>sinned</i>: For at this Rate of arguing, it might be urged, according
to this Rule (<i>Contrariorum par ratio</i>, i. e. <i>The Reason of Contraries
is alike</i>) that if, because a good Man hath sinned once or twice,
he can never be free from Sin, but must always be daily and continually
a Sinner all his Life long; then by the Rule of <i>Contraries</i>,
if a wicked Man have done Good once or twice, he can never be
free from Righteousness, but must always be a righteous Man all his
Life-time: Which as it is most absurd in itself, so it is contrary to
the plain Testimony of the Scripture, <i>Ezek.</i> xxxiii. 12. to 18.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj.</span><i>Lastly</i>, They object, <i>That if Perfection or Freedom from Sin be attainable,
this will render Mortification of Sin useless, and make the Blood of
Christ of no Service to us, neither need we any more pray for Forgiveness of
Sins</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, I had almost omitted this <i>Objection</i>, because of the manifest
<span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Aburdity">Absurdity</span> of it: For can Mortification of Sin be useless,
where the End of it is obtained? Seeing there is no attaining of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
Perfection but by Mortification.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Who fights and not in Hopes to overcome his</i> Foe?</span>Doth the Hope and Belief of
overcoming render the Fight unnecessary? Let rational Men
judge which hath most Sense in it, to say as our Adversaries do, <i>It
is necessary that we fight and wrestle, but we must never think of overcoming,
we must resolve still to be overcome</i>; or to say, <i>Let us fight, because
we may overcome</i>? Whether do such as believe they may be
cleansed by it, or those that believe they can never be cleansed by
it, render the <i>Blood of Christ</i> most effectual? If two Men were both
grievously diseased, and applied themselves to a Physician for Remedy,
which of those do most commend the Physician and his Cure,
he that believeth he may be cured by him, and as he feels himself
cured, confesseth that he is so, and so can say this is a skilful Physician,
this is a good Medicine, behold I am made whole by it;
or he that never is cured, nor ever believes that he can so long as
he lives?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Praying for</i> Forgiveness of Sins.</span>As for praying for <i>Forgiveness</i>, we deny it not; for that <i>all
have sinned</i>, and therefore all need to pray that their <i>Sins past</i> may be
blotted out, and that they may be daily preserved from sinning.
And if hoping or believing to be made <i>free from Sin</i> hinders praying
for <i>Forgiveness of Sin</i>, it would follow by the same Inference that
Men ought not to forsake Murder, Adultery, or any of these gross
Evils, seeing the more Men are sinful, the more plentiful Occasion
there would be of asking Forgiveness of Sin, and the more Work
for Mortification. But the Apostle had sufficiently refuted such sin-pleasing
Cavils in these Words, <i>Rom.</i> vi. 1, 2. <i>Shall we continue in Sin
that Grace may abound? God forbid.</i></p>

<p>But <i>Lastly</i>, It may be easily answered, by a Retortion to those
that press this from the Words of the Lord’s Prayer, <i>forgive us our
Debts</i>, that this militates no less against perfect Justification than
against perfect Sanctification: For if all the Saints, the least as well
as the greatest, be perfectly justified in that very Hour wherein they
are converted, as our Adversaries will have it, then they have
Remission of Sins long before they die. May it not then be said
to them, What Need have ye to pray for Remission of Sin, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
are already justified, whose Sins are long ago forgiven, both past
and to come?</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Testimonies of the Fathers, concerning </i>Perfection<i>, or </i>Freedom from Sin.</span>But this may suffice: Concerning this Possibility <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Jerom"><i>Jerome</i></span>

that a Man may not sin, if he will, for a Time and Place, according

so long as the Cords of the <i>Cithara</i> relax not by any Vice;”

again in the same Book, “Which is that that I said, that it is

either to sin or not to sin.” For this was the Error of <i>Pelagius</i>,
which we indeed reject and abhor, and which the <i>Fathers</i> deservedly
withstood, “That Man by his natural Strength, without the
Help of God’s Grace, could attain to that State so as not to
sin.”
<span class="sidenote">Augustine.</span>And <i>Augustine</i> himself, a great Opposer of the <i>Pelagian</i> Heresy,

Book <i>de Naturâ &amp; Gratiâ</i> against <i>Pelagius</i>, Cap. 42, 50, 60, and 63.

<span class="sidenote"><i>That by the </i>Gift of God<i> all Things are possible.</i></span>That this was

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> The first Sentence of this Proposition hath already been
treated of in the <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth Propositions</i>, where it hath
been shewn that that <i>Light</i> which is given for <i>Life</i> and <i>Salvation</i> becomes
the Condemnation of those that refuse it, and therefore is already
proved in those Places, where I did demonstrate the Possibility
of Man’s resisting the Grace and Spirit of God; and indeed it
is so apparent in the Scriptures, that it cannot be denied by such
as will but seriously consider these Testimonies, <i>Prov.</i> i. 24, 25, 26.
<i>John</i> iii. 18, 19. 2 <i>Thess.</i> ii. 11, 12. <i>Acts</i> vii. 51. &amp; xiii. 46. <i>Rom.</i> i. 18.
As for the other Part of it, that <i>they in whom this Grace may have
wrought in a good Measure in order to purify and sanctify them, tending to
their further Perfection, may afterwards, through Disobedience, fall away</i>, &amp;c.
The Testimonies of the Scripture included in the Proposition itself
are sufficient to prove it to Men of unbiassed Judgment; but because
as to this Part our Cause is common with many other <i>Protestants</i>, I
shall be the more brief in it: For it is not my Design to do that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
which is done already, neither do I covet to appear <i>knowing</i> by
writing much; but simply purpose to present to the World a faithful
Account of our Principles, and briefly to let them understand
what we have to say for ourselves.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I. <i>A Falling from Grace by Disobedience</i> evinced.</span>From these Scriptures then included in the Proposition, not
to mention many more which might be urged, I argue thus:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 1.</span><i>If Men may turn the </i>Grace of God<i> into Wantonness, then they must
once have had it</i>:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore also the Second.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 2.</span><i>If Men may make </i>Shipwreck of Faith<i>, they must once have had it;
Neither could they ever have had true</i> Faith <i>without the Grace of God</i>:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore also the Last.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 3.</span><i>If Men may have tasted of the </i>heavenly Gift<i>, and been made Partakers of
the </i>Holy Spirit<i>, and afterwards </i>fall away<i>, they must needs have known
in Measure the Operation of God’s saving Grace and Spirit, without which
no Man could taste the heavenly Gift, nor yet partake of the Holy Spirit</i>:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore also the Last.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>The Doctrine of </i>Election<i> and </i>Reprobation<i> is inconsistent with Preaching, and daily Exhortation.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, Seeing the contrary Doctrine is built upon this false
Hypothesis, That <i>Grace is not given for Salvation to any, but to a certain
elect Number, which cannot lose it, and that all the rest of Mankind, by an
</i>absolute Decree,<i> are debarred from Grace and Salvation</i>; that being destroyed,
this falls to the Ground. Now as that Doctrine of theirs
is wholly inconsistent with the daily Practice of those that preach it,
in that they exhort People to believe and be saved, while in the
mean Time, if they belong to the Decree of Reprobation, it is
simply impossible for them so to do; and if to the Decree of Election,
it is needless, seeing it is as impossible to them to miss of it, as
hath been before demonstrated. So also in this Matter of <i>Perseverance</i>,
their Practice and Principle are no less inconsistent and contradictory.
For while they daily exhort People to be <i>faithful to the
End</i>, shewing them if they continue not, they shall be <i>cut off</i>, and fall
short of the <i>Reward</i>; which is very true, but no less inconsistent with
that Doctrine that affirms <i>there is no Hazard, because no Possibility of de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>parting
from the least Measure of true Grace</i>; which if true, it is to no
Purpose to beseech them to <i>stand</i>, to whom God hath made it impossible
to <i>fall</i>. I shall not longer insist upon the Probation of this,
seeing what is said may suffice to answer my Design; and that the
Thing is also abundantly proved by many of the same Judgment.
That this was the Doctrine of the <i>primitive Protestants</i> thence appears,
that the <i>Augustine Confession</i> condemns it as an <i>Error</i> of the <i>Anabaptists</i>,
to say, <i>That they who once are justified, cannot lose the Holy Spirit</i>. Many
such like Sayings are to be found in the common Places of <i>Philip
Melancthon</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Opinion of the </i>Fathers<i> concerning </i>falling from Grace.</span><i>Vossius</i>, in his <i>Pelagian</i> History, Lib. 6. testifies, <i>That this
was the common Opinion of the Fathers</i>. In the Confirmation of the
<i>twelfth Thesis</i>, Page 587. he hath these Words: “That this which we
have said was the common Sentiment of Antiquity, those at present
can only deny, who otherwise perhaps are Men not unlearned,
but nevertheless in Antiquity altogether Strangers, <i>&amp;c.</i>”
These Things thus observed, I come to the <i>Objections</i> of our Opposers.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span><i>First</i>, They allege, <i>That those Places mentioned of making
</i>Shipwreck of Faith<i>, are only to be understood of seeming Faith, and not of
a real true Faith</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>A good and evil Conscience.</i></span>
This <i>Objection</i> is very weak, and apparently contrary to the Text,
1 <i>Tim.</i> i. 19. where the Apostle addeth to <i>Faith</i> a <i>good Conscience</i>, by
way of Complaint; whereas if their <i>Faith</i> had been only seeming
and hypocritical, the Men had been better without it than with it;
neither had they been worthy of Blame for losing that which in itself
was Evil. But the Apostle expresly adds [<i>and of a good Conscience</i>,]
which shews it was real; neither can it be supposed that
Men could truly attain a <i>good Conscience</i> without the Operation of
<i>God’s saving Grace</i>; far less that a <i>good Conscience</i> doth consist with a
seeming false and hypocritical Faith. Again, these Places of the
Apostle being spoken by way of Regret, clearly import that these
Attainments they had fallen from were good and real, not false and
deceitful, else he would not have regretted their falling from them;
and so he saith positively, <i>They tasted of the heavenly Gift, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
made Partakers of the Holy Ghost</i>, &amp;c. not that they seemed to be so,
which sheweth this <i>Objection</i> is very frivolous.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They allege, <i>Phil.</i> i. 6. <i>Being confident of this very Thing,
that he which hath begun a good Work in you will perform it until the Day
of Jesus Christ</i>, &amp;c. and 1 <i>Pet.</i> i. 5. <i>Who are kept by the Power of God
through Faith unto Salvation.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>These Scriptures, as they do not affirm any Thing positively contrary
to us, so they cannot be understood otherwise than as the
Condition is performed upon our Part,
<span class="sidenote">Salvation<i> is proposed upon certain Conditions by us to be performed.</i></span>seeing <i>Salvation</i> is no otherways
proposed there but upon certain necessary Conditions to be
performed by us, as hath been above proved, and as our Adversaries
also acknowledge, as <i>Rom.</i> viii. 13. <i>For if ye live after the Flesh, ye shall
die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye shall
live</i>. And <i>Heb.</i> iii. 14. <i>We are made Partakers of Christ, if we hold the
Beginning of our Confidence stedfast unto the End</i>. For if these Places of
the Scripture upon which they build their Objections were to be
admitted without these Conditions, it would manifestly overturn
the whole Tenor of their Exhortations throughout all their Writings.
Some other <i>Objections</i> there are of the same Nature, which are solved
by the same Answers, which also, because largely treated of by
others, I omit, to come to that Testimony of the Truth which is more
especially ours in this Matter, and is contained in the latter Part of
the Proposition in these Words: <i>Yet such an Increase and Stability in the
Truth may in this Life be attained, from which there cannot be a total Apostasy</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> As in the Explanation of the <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth Proposition</i> I observed,
that some that had denied the Errors of others concerning
<i>Reprobation</i>, and affirmed the <i>Universality of Christ’s Death</i>, did notwithstanding
fall short in sufficiently holding forth the Truth, and so
gave the contrary Party Occasion by their Defects to be strengthened
in their Errors, so it may be said in this Case.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The two Extremes some run into, by asserting a final</i> Falling <i>or</i> not Falling <i>from Grace impossible.</i></span>As upon the
one Hand they err who affirm, <i>That the least Degree of true and saving
Grace cannot be fallen from</i>, so do they err upon the other Hand that
deny any such <i>Stability</i> to be attained <i>from which there cannot be a total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
and final Apostasy</i>. And betwixt these two extremes lieth the Truth
apparent in the Scriptures, which God hath revealed unto us by
the Testimony of his Spirit, and which also we are made sensible of
by our own Experience. And even as in the former Controversy was
observed, so also in this, the Defence of Truth will readily appear
to such as seriously weigh the Matter; for the Arguments upon both
Hands, rightly applied, will as to this hold good; and the Objections,
which are strong as they are respectively urged against the
two opposite <i>false Opinions</i>, are here easily solved, by the Establishing
of this <i>Truth</i>. For all the Arguments which these allege that
affirm, <i>There can be no falling away</i>, may well be received upon the
one Part, as of those who have attained to this Stability and Establishment,
and their Objections solved by this Confession; so upon
the other Hand, the Arguments alleged from Scripture Testimonies
by those that affirm <i>the Possibility of falling away</i> may well be received
of such as are not come to this Establishment, though having attained
a Measure of true Grace. Thus then the contrary Batterings
of Our Adversaries, who miss the Truth, do concur the more strongly
to establish it, while they are destroying each other. But lest this
may not seem to suffice to satisfy such as judge it <i>always possible for the
best of Men before they die to fall away</i>, I shall add, for the Proof of it,
some brief Considerations from some few Testimonies of the Scripture.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I. Watchfulness<i> and </i>Diligence<i> is of indispensible Necessity to all.</i></span>
And <i>First</i>, I freely acknowledge that it is good for all to be
humble, and in this Respect not over confident, so as to lean to this,
to foster themselves in Iniquity, or lie down in Security, as if they
had attained this Condition, seeing <i>Watchfulness</i> and <i>Diligence</i> is of
<i>indispensible Necessity</i> to all mortal Men, so long as they breathe in
this World; for God will have this to be the constant Practice of a
<i>Christian</i>, that thereby he may be the more fit to serve him, and better
armed against all the Temptations of the Enemy. For since <i>the
Wages of Sin is Death</i>, there is no Man, while he sinneth, and is subject
thereunto, but may lawfully suppose himself capable of perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>ing.
Hence the Apostle <i>Paul</i> himself saith, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 27. <i>But I keep
under my Body, and bring it into Subjection, lest that by any Means, when
I have preached to others, I myself should be a Cast-away.</i> Here the Apostle
supposes it possible for him to be a <i>Cast-away</i>; and yet it may be
judged he was far more advanced in the inward Work of <i>Regeneration</i>,
when he wrote that <i>Epistle</i>, than many who now-a-days too presumptuously
suppose they cannot <i>fall away</i>, because they feel themselves
to have attained some small Degree of true <i>Grace</i>. But the
Apostle makes Use of this Supposition or Possibility of his being a
<i>Cast-away</i>, as I before observed, as an Inducement to them to be
watchful; <i>I keep under my Body, lest</i>, &amp;c. Nevertheless the same
Apostle, at another Time, in the Sense and Feeling of <i>God’s holy
Power</i>, and in the <i>Dominion</i> thereof, finding himself a Conqueror therethrough
over Sin and his Soul’s Enemies, maketh no Difficulty to
affirm, <i>Rom.</i> viii. 38. <i>For I am persuaded that neither Death nor Life</i>, &amp;c.
which clearly sheweth that he had attained a Condition from which
he knew he could not <i>fall away</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>A Condition attainable in this Life, from which there is no </i>Falling away.</span>
But <i>Secondly</i>, It appears such a Condition is attainable, because
we are exhorted to it; and, as hath been proved before, the
Scripture never proposeth to us Things impossible. Such an Exhortation
we have from the Apostle, 2 <i>Pet.</i> i. 10. <i>Wherefore the rather,
Brethren, give Diligence to make your Calling and Election sure.</i> And
though there be a Condition here proposed, yet since we have already
proved that it is possible to fulfil this Condition, then also
the Promise annexed thereunto may be attained. And since, where
Assurance is wanting, there is still a Place left for Doubtings and
Despairs, if we should affirm it never attainable, then should there
never be a Place known by the Saints in this World, wherein they
might be free of Doubting and Despair; which as it is most absurd
in itself, so it is contrary to the manifest Experience of Thousands.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">III. <i>A certain Assurance and Establishment given of God to many of his Saints and Children.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, God hath given to many of his Saints and Children,
and is ready to give unto <i>all</i>, a <i>full</i> and <i>certain Assurance</i> that they
are his, and that no Power shall be able to pluck them out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
Hand. But this Assurance would be no Assurance, if those who
are so <i>assured</i> were not <i>established</i> and <i>confirmed</i> beyond all Doubt and
Hesitation: If so, then surely there is no Possibility for such to miss
of that which God hath assured them of. And that there is such
<i>Assurance</i> attainable in this Life, the Scripture abundantly declareth,
both in general and as to particular Persons. As <i>first</i>,
<i>Rev.</i> iii. 12. <i>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my
God, and he shall go no more out</i>, &amp;c. which containeth a general Promise
unto all. Hence the Apostle speaks of some that are <i>sealed</i>,
2 Cor. i. 22. <i>Who hath also sealed us, and given the Earnest of the Spirit
in our Hearts</i>: Wherefore the <i>Spirit </i>so<i> sealing </i>is called the<i> Earnest </i>or<i>
Pledge of our Inheritance</i>, Ephes. i. 13. <i>In whom ye were sealed by the
Holy Spirit of Promise</i>. And therefore the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, not only in
that of the <i>Romans</i> above noted, declareth himself to have attained
that Condition, but 2 <i>Tim.</i> iv. 7. he affirmeth in these Words, <i>I
have fought a good Fight</i>, &amp;c. which also many good <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Man">Men</span> have and
do witness. And therefore as there can be nothing more evident
than that which the <i>manifest Experience</i> of this Time sheweth, and
therein is found agreeable to the Experience of former Times, so we
see there have been both of <i>old</i> and of <i>late</i> that have <i>turned the Grace
of God into Wantonness</i>, and have <i>fallen from their Faith and Integrity</i>;
thence we may safely conclude such a <i>Falling away possible</i>. We also
see that some of <i>old</i> and of <i>late</i> have attained a certain Assurance,
some Time before they departed, that they should <i>inherit eternal Life</i>,
and have accordingly died in that <i>good Hope</i>, of and concerning
whom the Spirit of God testified <i>that they are saved</i>. Wherefore we
all see such a State is attainable in this Life, from which there is not
a <i>Falling away</i>: For seeing the Spirit of God did so testify, it was not
possible that they should perish, concerning whom <i>he who cannot lie</i>
thus bare Witness.</p>

<p class="center">Concerning the <span class="smcap">Ministry</span>.</p>

<p class="chapter-head"><i>As by the </i>Light<i> or </i>Gift<i> of God all true Knowledge in Things
spiritual is received and revealed, so by the same, as it is manifested
and received in the Heart, by the Strength and Power
thereof, every true </i>Minister<i> of the </i>Gospel<i> is ordained, prepared,
and supplied in the Work of the </i>Ministry<i>; and by the
Leading, Moving, and Drawing hereof ought every </i>Evangelist<i>
and </i>Christian Pastor<i> to be led and ordered in his Labour and
Work of the Gospel, both as to the Place </i>where<i>, as to the Persons
</i>to whom<i>, and as to the Time </i>wherein<i> he is to </i>minister<i>.
Moreover they who have this Authority may and ought to preach
the </i>Gospel<i>, though without </i>human Commission<i> or </i>Literature<i>;
as on the other Hand, they who want the Authority of
this </i>divine Gift<i>, however learned, or authorized by the </i>Commission<i>
of </i>Men<i> and </i>Churches<i>, are to be esteemed but as </i>Deceivers<i>,

<span class="sidenote">The Gospel to be preached freely. Mat. 10. 8.</span><i>Also they

or Bargaining, far less to use it as a </i>Trade<i> to get Money by:
Yet God hath called any one from their Employment or Trades,
by which they acquire their Livelihood, it may be lawful for such,
according to the Liberty which they feel given them in the Lord,
to receive such Temporals (to wit, what may be needful for them
for Meat and Clothing) as are given them freely and cordially
by those to whom they have communicated Spirituals.</i></p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> Hitherto I have treated of those Things which relate
to the <i>Christian Faith</i> and <i>Christians</i>, as they stand each
in his private and particular Condition, and how and by what
Means every Man may be a <i>Christian</i> indeed, and so abide. Now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
come in order to speak of those Things that relate to <i>Christians</i>, as
they are stated in a <i>joint Fellowship</i> and <i>Communion</i>, and come under a
visible and outward <i>Society</i>, which <i>Society</i> is called the <i>Church of God</i>,
and in Scripture compared to a <i>Body</i>, and therefore named the
<i>Body of Christ</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Church of God is the spiritual Body of Christ.</i></span>As then in the natural Body there be divers Members,
all concurring to the common End of preserving and confirming
the whole Body, so in this <i>spiritual</i> and <i>mystical Body</i> there are
also divers Members, according to the different Measures of <i>Grace</i>
and of the <i>Spirit</i> diversly administered unto <i>each Member</i>; and from
this <i>Diversity</i> ariseth that Distinction of Persons in the <i>visible Society</i> of
<i>Christians</i>, as of <i>Apostles</i>, <i>Pastors</i>, <i>Evangelists</i>, <i>Ministers</i>, &amp;c. That which
in this Proposition is proposed, is, <i>What makes or constitutes any a Minister
of the Church, what his Qualifications ought to be, and how he ought to
behave himself?</i> But because it may seem somewhat preposterous to
speak of the <i>distinct Offices</i> of the <i>Church</i> until something be said of the
<i>Church</i> in general, though nothing positively be said of it in the
Proposition; yet, as here implied, I shall briefly premise something
thereof, and then proceed to the particular Members of it.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3> It is not in the least my Design to meddle with those tedious
and many Controversies wherewith the <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> do
tear one another concerning this Thing; but only according to the
Truth manifested to me, and revealed in me by the Testimony of the
Spirit, according to that Proportion of Wisdom given me, briefly to
hold forth as a necessary Introduction both to this Matter of the
<i>Ministry</i> and of <i>Worship</i>, which followeth those Things which I, together
with my <i>Brethren</i>, do believe concerning the <i>Church</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">I.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Etymology<i> of the Word </i>[Greek: ekklêsia: εκκλησια]<i> (the Church) and Signification of it.</i></span> The <i>Church</i> then, according to the grammatical Signification of
the Word, as it is used in the holy Scripture, signifies an <i>Assembly</i> or
<i>Gathering of many into one Place</i>; for the Substantive [Greek: ekklêsia: εκκλησια] comes from
the Word [Greek: ekkaleô: εκκαλεω] <i>I call out of</i>, and originally from [Greek: kaleô: καλεω] <i>I call</i>; and
indeed, as this is the grammatical Sense of the Word, so also it is the
real and proper Signification of the Thing, the <i>Church</i> being no
other Thing but the <i>Society</i>, <i>Gathering</i>, or <i>Company of such as God hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
called out of the World, and worldly Spirit, to walk in his <span class="smcap">Light</span> and
<span class="smcap">Life</span>.</i> The <i>Church</i> then so defined is to be considered as it comprehends
all that are thus <i>called</i> and <i>gathered</i> truly by God, both such
as are yet in this inferior World, and such as having already laid
down the earthly Tabernacle, are passed into their heavenly Mansions,
which together do make up the one <i>Catholick Church</i>, concerning
which there is so much Controversy.
<span class="sidenote"><i>No Salvation without the</i> Church.</span>Out of which <i>Church</i> we
freely acknowledge there can be no Salvation; because under this
<i>Church</i> and its Denomination are comprehended all, and as many,
of whatsoever <i>Nation</i>, <i>Kindred</i>, <i>Tongue</i>, or <i>People</i> they be, though outwardly
Strangers, and remote from those who profess <i>Christ</i> and
<i>Christianity</i> in Words, and have the Benefit of the Scriptures, as become
obedient to the <i>holy Light</i> and <i>Testimony of God</i> in their Hearts,
so as to become sanctified by it, and cleansed from the Evils of their
Ways.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What the</i> Church <i>is</i>.</span>For this is the <i>Universal</i> or <i>Catholick Spirit</i>, by which many
are called from all the <i>four Corners of the Earth, and shall sit down with
</i>Abraham, Isaac, <i>and </i>Jacob: By this the <i>secret Life and Virtue</i> of Jesus
is conveyed into many that are afar off, even as by the Blood that
runs into the Veins and Arteries of the natural Body the Life is
conveyed from the Head and Heart unto the extreme Parts.
<span class="sidenote">Turks<i> and </i>Jews<i> may become Members of this </i>Church.</span>There
may be Members therefore of this <i>Catholick Church</i> both among <i>Heathens</i>,
<i>Turks</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and all the several Sorts of <i>Christians</i>, Men and
Women of Integrity and Simplicity of Heart, who though blinded
in some Things in their Understanding, and perhaps burdened with
the Superstitions and Formality of the several Sects in which they
are ingrossed, yet being upright in their Hearts before the Lord,
chiefly aiming and labouring to be delivered from Iniquity, and
loving to follow Righteousness, are by the secret Touches of this
<i>holy Light</i> in their Souls enlivened and quickened, thereby secretly
united to God, and therethrough become true Members of this <i>Catholick
Church</i>. Now the <i>Church</i> in this Respect hath been in Being in
all Generations; for God never wanted some such Witnesses for
him, though many Times slighted, and not much observed by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
World; and therefore this <i>Church</i>, though still in Being, hath been
oftentimes as it were invisible, in that it hath not come under the
Observations of the Men of this World, being, as saith the Scripture,
<i>Jer.</i> iii. 14. <i>One of a City, and two of a Family.</i> And yet though
the <i>Church</i> thus considered may be as it were hid from wicked Men,
as not then gathered into a <i>visible Fellowship</i>, yea, and not observed
even by some that are Members of it, yet may there notwithstanding
many belong to it; as when <i>Elias</i> complained he was <i>left alone</i>,
1 Kings xix. 18. God answered unto him, <i>I have reserved to myself
seven thousand Men, who have not bowed their Knees to the Image of </i>Baal;
whence the Apostle argues, <i>Rom.</i> xi. the Being of a <i>Remnant</i> in his
Day.</p>

<span class="sidenote">II.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Definition of the </i>Church<i> of </i>God<i>, as gathered into a </i>visible Fellowship.</span>
<i>Secondly</i>, The <i>Church</i> is to be considered as it signifies a
certain Number of Persons gathered by God’s Spirit, and by the
Testimony of some of his Servants raised up for that End, unto the
Belief of the true Principles and Doctrines of the Christian Faith,
who through their Hearts being united by the same Love, and their
Understandings informed in the same Truths, gather, meet, and
assemble together to wait upon God, to worship him, and to bear a
joint Testimony for the <i>Truth</i> against <i>Error</i>, suffering for the same,
and so becoming through this Fellowship as one Family and Houshold
in certain Respects, do each of them watch over, teach, instruct,
and care for one another, according to their several Measures and
Attainments: Such were the <i>Churches</i> of the primitive Times gathered
by the Apostles; whereof we have divers mentioned in the holy
Scriptures. And as to the <i>Visibility</i> of the <i>Church</i> in this Respect, there
hath been a great Interruption since the Apostles Days, by Reason
of the <i>Apostasy</i>, as will hereafter appear.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>How to become a Member of that</i> Church.</span>To be a <i>Member</i> then of the <i>Catholick Church</i>, there is Need
of the <i>Inward Calling of God</i> by his <i>Light in the Heart</i>, and a being
leavened into the Nature and Spirit of it, so as to forsake Unrighteousness,
and be turned to Righteousness, and in the Inwardness of
the Mind to be cut out of the <i>wild Olive Tree</i> of our own first fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
Nature, and ingrafted into <i>Christ</i> by his <i>Word</i> and <i>Spirit in the Heart</i>.
And this may be done in those who are Strangers to the History,
(God not having pleased to make them Partakers thereof) as in the
<i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth Propositions</i> hath already been proved.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>outward Profession<i> of the Members of the </i>true Church.</span>To be a <i>Member</i> of a particular <i>Church of Christ</i>, as this inward
Work is indispensibly necessary, so is also the outward Profession of,
and Belief in, Jesus Christ, and those holy Truths delivered by his
Spirit in the Scriptures; seeing the Testimony of the Spirit recorded
in the Scriptures, doth answer the Testimony of the same Spirit in
the Heart, even as <i>Face answereth Face in a Glass</i>. Hence it follows,
that the inward Work of Holiness, and forsaking Iniquity, is necessary
in every Respect to the being a Member in the <i>Church of Christ</i>;
and that the outward Profession is necessary to be a Member of a
particular gathered <i>Church</i>, but not to the being a Member of the
<i>Catholick Church</i>; yet it is absolutely necessary, where God affords the
Opportunity of knowing it: And the outward Testimony is to be
believed, where it is presented and revealed; the Sum whereof hath
upon other Occasions been already proved.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Members of the Antichristian Church in the Apostasy, their empty Profession.</i></span>But contrary hereunto, the Devil, that worketh and hath
wrought in the <i>Mystery of Iniquity</i>, hath taught his Followers to affirm,
<i>That no Man, however holy, is a Member of the Church of Christ without
the outward Profession; and unless he be initiated thereinto by some outward
Ceremonies</i>. And again, <i>That Men who have this outward Profession,
though inwardly unholy, may be Members of the true Church of Christ, yea,
and ought to be so esteemed</i>. This is plainly to put <i>Light</i> for <i>Darkness</i>,
and <i>Darkness</i> for <i>Light</i>; as if God had a greater Regard to Words
than Actions, and were more pleased with vain Professions than
with real Holiness: But these Things I have sufficiently refuted
heretofore. Only from hence let it be observed, that upon this
false and rotten Foundation <i>Antichrist</i> hath built his <i>Babylonish Structure</i>,
and the <i>Antichristian Church</i> in the <i>Apostasy</i> hath hereby reared herself
up to that Height and Grandeur she hath attained; so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
exalt herself above <i>all that is called God, and sit in the Temple of God
as God</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Decay of the </i>Church.</span>For the particular <i>Churches</i> of <i>Christ</i>, gathered in the Apostles Days,
soon after beginning to decay as to the <i>inward Life</i>, came to be overgrown
with several Errors, and the Hearts of the Professors of <i>Christianity</i>
to be leavened with the old Spirit and Conversation of the
World. Yet it pleased God for some <i>Centuries</i> to preserve that <i>Life</i>
in many, whom he emboldened with Zeal to stand and suffer for
his Name through the <i>ten Persecutions</i>: But these being over, the
Meekness, Gentleness, Love, Long-suffering, Goodness, and Temperance
of <i>Christianity</i> began to be lost.
<span class="sidenote"><i>When Men became Christians by </i>Birth<i>, and not by </i>Conversion<i>, Christianity came to be lost.</i></span>For after that the Princes
of the Earth came to take upon them that Profession, and that it
ceased to be a Reproach to be a <i>Christian</i>, but rather became a Means
to Preferment; Men became such by Birth and Education, and not
by Conversion and Renovation of Spirit: Then there was none
so vile, none so wicked, none so profane, who became not a Member
of the <i>Church</i>. And the <i>Teachers</i> and <i>Pastors</i> thereof becoming
the Companions of Princes, and so being enriched by their Benevolence,
and getting vast Treasures and Estates, became puffed up,
and as it were drunken with the vain Pomp and Glory of this World:
And so marshalled themselves in manifold Orders and Degrees; not
without innumerable Contests and Altercations who should have the
<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>Precedency. So the Virtue, Life, Substance, and Kernel of <i>Christian
Religion</i> came to be lost, and nothing remained but a Shadow and
Image; which dead Image, or Carcase of <i>Christianity</i> (to make it take
the better with the superstitious Multitude of <i>Heathens</i> that were engrossed
in it, not by any inward Conversion of their Hearts, or by
becoming less wicked or superstitious, but by a little Change in
the Object of their Superstition) not having the inward Ornament
and Life of the Spirit, became decked with many outward and visible
Orders, and beautified with the Gold, Silver, precious Stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
and the other splendid Ornaments of this perishing World: So that
this was no more to be accounted the <i>Christian Religion</i>, and <i>Christian
Church</i>, notwithstanding the outward Profession, than the <i>dead Body</i>
of a Man is to be accounted a <i>living Man</i>; which, however cunningly
embalmed, and adorned with ever so much Gold or Silver, or most
precious Stones, or sweet Ointments, is but a dead Body still, without
Sense, Life, or Motion.
<span class="sidenote"><i>In the Church of </i>Rome<i> are no less Superstitions and Ceremonies introduced, than were either among </i>Jews<i> or </i>Heathens.</span>For that <i>Apostate Church</i> of <i>Rome</i> has introduced
no fewer Ceremonies and Superstitions into the <i>Christian
Profession</i>, than were either among <i>Jews</i> or <i>Heathens</i>; and that there
is and hath been as much, yea, and more Pride, Covetousness, Uncleanness,
Luxury, Fornication, Profaneness and Atheism among
her Teachers and chief Bishops, than ever was among any Sort of
People, none need doubt, that have read their own Authors, to wit,
<i>Platina</i> and others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Whether, and what Difference there is betwixt the </i>Protestants<i> and </i>Papists<i> in Superstitions.</i></span>Now, though <i>Protestants</i> have reformed from her in some of the
most gross Points and absurd Doctrines relating to the <i>Church</i> and
<i>Ministry</i>, yet (which is to be regretted) they have only lopt off the
Branches, but retain and plead earnestly for the same Root, from
which these Abuses have sprung. So that even among them, though
all that Mass of Superstition, Ceremonies, and Orders be not again
established, yet the same Pride, Covetousness and Sensuality is found
to have overspread and leavened their <i>Churches</i> and <i>Ministry</i>, and the
Life, Power and Virtue of <i>true Religion</i> is lost among them; and the
very same Death, Barrenness, Dryness and Emptiness, is found in
their <i>Ministry</i>. So that in Effect they differ from <i>Papists</i> but in Form
and some Ceremonies; being with them apostatised from the Life
and Power the true <i>Primitive Church</i> and her <i>Pastors</i> were in: So that
of both it may be said truly (without Breach of Charity) that
having only a <i>Form of Godliness</i> (and many of them not so much as
that) they are <i>Deniers</i> of, yea, <i>Enemies</i> to, the Power of it. And
this proceeds not simply from their not walking answerably to their
own Principles, and so degenerating that Way, which also is true;
but, which is worse, their laying down to themselves, and adhering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
to certain Principles, which naturally, as a cursed Root, bring forth
these bitter Fruits: These therefore shall afterwards be examined and
refuted, as the contrary Positions of Truth in the Proposition are explained
and proved.</p>

<p>For as to the Nature and Constitution of a Church<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> (abstract from
their Disputes concerning its constant Visibility, Infallibility, and
the Primacy of the Church of Rome) the Protestants, as in Practice, so
in Principles, differ not from <i>Papists</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestant<i> Church how they become Members thereof.</i></span>for they engross within the
Compass of their <i>Church</i> whole Nations, making their Infants Members
of it, by sprinkling a little Water upon them; so that there is
none so wicked or profane who is not a Fellow-member; no Evidence
of Holiness being required to constitute a Member of the
<i>Church</i>. Nay, look through the <i>Protestant Nations</i>, and there will no
Difference appear in the Lives of the Generality of the One, more
than of the Other; he, who <i>ruleth in the Children of Disobedience</i>, reigning
in both:
<span class="sidenote">Christianity<i> chiefly consists in the Renewing of the </i>Heart.</span>So that the <i>Reformation</i>, through this Defect, is only in
holding some less gross Errors in the Notion, but not in having the
Heart reformed and renewed, in which mainly the <i>Life</i> of <i>Christianity</i>
consisteth.</p>

minister Death and Iniquity. The whole <i>Backslidings</i> of the <i>Jewish

such Complaints; and for this Cause, under the <i>New Testament</i>, we

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 1.</span>That then which comes first to be questioned in this
Matter, is concerning the <i>Call of a Minister</i>; to wit, <i>What maketh, or
how cometh a Man to be, a Minister, Pastor, or Teacher in the Church of
Christ?</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Call of a </i>Minister<i> and wherein it consisteth.</i></span>
We <i>answer</i>; By the <i>inward Power and Virtue of the Spirit of God</i>. For,
as saith our Proposition, <i>Having received the true Knowledge of Things
spiritual by the Spirit of God, without which they cannot be known, and being
by the same in Measure purified and sanctified, he comes thereby to be
called and moved to minister to others</i>; being able to speak, from a living
Experience, of what he himself is a Witness; and therefore <i>knowing
the Terror of the Lord, he is fit to persuade Men</i>, &amp;c. 2 Cor. v. 11. and
his Words and Ministry, proceeding from the inward Power and
Virtue, reach to the Heart of his Hearers, and make them approve
of him, and be subject unto him.
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>Our Adversaries are forced to
confess, that this were indeed <span class="correction" title="In the original book: desireable">desirable</span> and best; but this they will
not have to be absolutely necessary. I shall first prove the Necessity
of it, and then shew how much they err in that which they make
more necessary than this divine and heavenly Call.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span><span class="sidenote">1. <i>The Necessity of an </i>inward Call<i> to make a Man a </i>Christian.</span>
<i>First</i>, That which is necessary to make a Man a <i>Christian</i>, so as
without it he cannot be truly one, must be much more necessary to
make a Man a <i>Minister of Christianity</i>; seeing the one is a Degree above
the other, and has it included in it: Nothing less than he that supposeth
a <i>Master</i>, supposeth him first to have attained the Knowledge
and Capacity of a <i>Scholar</i>. They that are not <i>Christians</i>, cannot be
Teachers and Ministers among <i>Christians</i>.</p>

<p>But this inward Call, Power and Virtue of the Spirit of God,
is necessary to make a Man a <i>Christian</i>; as we have abundantly proved
before in the second Proposition, according to these Scriptures, <i>He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his. As many as are led by the
Spirit of God, are the Sons of God</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore this Call, Moving and Drawing of the Spirit, must be
much more necessary to make a Man a <i>Minister</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">2. <i>The Ministry of the Spirit requires the Operation and Testimony of the Spirit.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, All <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>New Testament</i> ought to be <i>Ministers</i> of
the <i>Spirit</i>, and not of the <i>Letter</i>, according to that of 2 <i>Cor.</i> iii. 6.
and as the old Latin hath it, <i>Not by the Letter, but by the Spirit</i>: But
how can a Man be a Minister of the Spirit, who is not inwardly
called by it, and who looks not upon the Operation and Testimony
of the Spirit as essential to his Call? As he could not be a
Minister of the Letter who had thence no Ground for his Call, yea,
who was altogether a Stranger to and unacquainted with it, so neither
can he be a Minister of the Spirit who is a Stranger to it, and unacquainted
with the Motions thereof, and knows it not to draw,
act, and move him, and go before him in the Work of the <i>Ministry</i>.
I would willingly know, how those that take upon them to be Ministers
(as they suppose) of the Gospel, merely from an outward
Vocation, without so much as being any ways sensible of the Work
of the Spirit, or any inward Call therefrom, can either satisfy themselves
or others that they are <i>Ministers of the Spirit</i>, or wherein they
differ from the <i>Ministers of the Letter</i>? For,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">3. <i>Under the Law the People needed not to doubt, who should be Priests and Ministers.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, If this inward Call, or Testimony of the Spirit, were not
essential and necessary to a <i>Minister</i>, then the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>New Testament</i>
would not only be no ways preferable to, but in divers Respects
far worse than that of the <i>Law</i>. For under the <i>Law</i> there was
a certain Tribe allotted for the <i>Ministry</i>, and of that Tribe certain
Families set apart for the <i>Priesthood</i> and other Offices, by the immediate
Command of God to <i>Moses</i>; so that the People needed not be
in any Doubt who should be Priests and Ministers of the holy Things:
Yea, and besides this, God called forth, by the immediate Testimony
of his Spirit, several at divers Times to teach, instruct, and reprove
his People, as <i>Samuel</i>, <i>Nathan</i>, <i>Elias</i>, <i>Elisha</i>, <i>Jeremiah</i>, <i>Amos</i>, and many
more of the Prophets: But now under the <i>New Covenant</i>, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
<i>Ministry</i> ought to be more <i>spiritual</i>, the <i>Way</i> more <i>certain</i>, and the <i>Access</i>
more <i>easy</i> unto the Lord, our Adversaries, by denying the Necessity
of this inward and spiritual Vocation, make it quite otherways.
For there being now no certain Family or Tribe to which the <i>Ministry</i>
is limited, we are left in Uncertainty, to choose and have <i>Pastors</i> at
a Venture, without any certain Assent of the Will of God; having
neither an outward Rule nor Certainty in this Affair to walk by:
For that the Scripture cannot give any certain Rule in this Matter,
hath in the <i>third Proposition</i> concerning it been already shewn.</p>

Ministry thus through the <i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i>. As, <i>First</i>, They must acknowledge
her to be a true <i>Church</i> of <i>Christ</i>, though only erroneous
in some Things; which contradicts their <i>Forefathers</i> so frequently,
and yet truly, calling her <i>Antichrist</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, They must needs acknowledge,
that the <i>Priests</i> and <i>Bishops</i> of the <i>Romish Church</i> are true
<i>Ministers</i> and <i>Pastors</i> of the <i>Church</i> of <i>Christ</i>, as to the essential Part;
else they could not be fit Subjects for that Power and Authority to
have resided in; neither could they have been Vessels capable to receive
that Power, and again transmit it to their Successors. <i>Thirdly</i>,
It would follow from this, that the <i>Priests</i> and <i>Bishops</i> of the <i>Romish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
Church</i> are yet really true <i>Pastors</i> and <i>Teachers</i>: For if <i>Protestant Ministers</i>
have no Authority but what they received from them, and
since the <i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i> is the same she was at that Time of the Reformation
in Doctrine and Manners, and she has the same Power
now she had then, and if the Power lie in the <i>Succession</i>, then these
<i>Priests</i> of the <i>Romish Church</i> now, which derive their Ordination from
those <i>Bishops</i> that ordained the first <i>Reformers</i>, have the same Authority
which the Successors of the Reformed have, and consequently
are no less <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Church</i> than they are. But how will this
agree with that Opinion which the <i>Primitive Protestants</i> had of the

<span class="sidenote"><i>The pretended Succession of </i>Papists<i> and </i>Protestants<i> explained.</i></span>But against this vain Succession, as asserted either by the
<i>Papists</i> or <i>Protestants</i> as a necessary Thing to the Call of a Minister, I
<i>answer</i>; That such as plead for it, as a sufficient or necessary Thing
to the Call of a Minister, do thereby sufficiently declare their Ignorance
of the Nature of <i>Christianity</i>, and how much they are Strangers
to the Life and Power of a <i>Christian Ministry</i>, which is not entailed to
Succession, as an outward Inheritance; and herein, as hath been
often before observed, they not only make the <i>Gospel</i> not better than
the <i>Law</i>, but even far short of it. For <i>Jesus Christ</i>, as he regardeth
not any distinct particular Family or Nation in the gathering of his
Children; but only such as are joined to and leavened with his own
<i>pure</i> and <i>righteous Seed</i>, so neither regards he a bare outward Succession,
where his pure, immaculate, and righteous Life is wanting;
for that were all one. He took not the Nations into the <i>New Covenant</i>,
that he might suffer them to fall into the old Errors of the
<i>Jews</i>, or to approve them in their Errors, but that he might gather
unto himself a pure People out of the Earth. Now this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
great Error of the <i>Jews</i>, to think they were the Church and People
of God, because they could derive their outward Succession from <i>Abraham</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Jews<i> Error of </i>Abraham<i>’s outward Succession.</i></span>whereby they reckoned themselves the <i>Children of God</i>, as
being the Offspring of <i>Abraham</i>, who was the <i>Father of the Faithful</i>.
But how severely doth the Scripture rebuke this vain and frivolous
Pretence? Telling them, <i>That God is able of the Stones to raise Children
unto Abraham</i>; and that not the outward <i>Seed</i>, but those that were
found in the <i>Faith</i> of <i>Abraham</i>, are the true <i>Children</i> of faithful <i>Abraham</i>.
Far less then can this Pretence hold among <i>Christians</i>, seeing
Christ rejects all outward Affinity of that Kind: <a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a><i>These</i>, saith he, <i>are
my Mother, Brethren and Sisters, who do the Will of my Father which is in
Heaven</i>: And again; <i>He looked round about him, and said, Who shall do
the Will of God, these</i>, saith he, <i>are my Brethren</i>. So then, such as do
not the Commands of Christ, are not found clothed with his Righteousness,
are not his Disciples; and that which a Man hath not,
he cannot give to another: And it is clear, that no Man nor Church,
though truly called of God, and as such having the Authority of a
Church and Minister, can any longer retain that Authority, than
they retain the Power, Life, and Righteousness of <i>Christianity</i>; for the
Form is entailed to the Power and Substance, and not the Substance to the Form.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Form of Godliness is entailed to the Power and Substance, and not the Substance to the Form.</i></span>So that when a Man ceaseth inwardly in his
Heart to be a <i>Christian</i> (where his Christianity must lie) by turning
to Satan, and becoming a Reprobate, he is no more a <i>Christian</i>,
though he retain the Name and Form, than a dead Man is a Man,
though he hath the Image and Representation of one, or than the
Picture or Statue of a Man is a Man: And though a dead Man may
serve to a Painter to retain some imperfect Representation of the
Man, that once was alive, and so one Picture may serve to make
another by, yet none of those can serve to make a true living Man
again, neither can they convey the Life and Spirit of the Man; it
must be God, that made the Man at first, that alone can revive him.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Succession interrupted.</i></span>As Death then makes such Interruption of an outward natural
Succession, that no Art nor outward Form can uphold, and as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
dead Man, after he is dead, can have no Issue, neither can dead
Images of Men make living Men: So that it is the Living that are
only capable to succeed one another; and such as die, so soon as
they die cease to succeed, or to transmit Succession. So it is in spiritual
Things; it is the Life of Christianity, taking Place in the Heart,
that makes a Christian;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Living Members make the Church: Life lost, the Church is ceased.</i></span>and so it is a Number of such, being alive,
joined together in the Life of Christianity, that make a Church of
Christ; and it is all those that are thus alive and quickened, considered
together, that make the Catholick Church of Christ: Therefore
when this Life ceaseth in one, then that one ceaseth to be a
Christian; and all Power, Virtue, and Authority, which he had as
a Christian, ceaseth with it; so that if he hath been a Minister or
Teacher, he ceaseth to be so any more: And though he retain the
Form, and hold to the Authority in Words, yet that signifies no
more, nor is it of any more real Virtue and Authority, than the
mere Image of a dead Man.
<span class="sidenote">Judas <i>fell from his Ministry by Transgression</i>.</span>And as this is most agreeable to Reason,
so it is to the Scripture’s Testimony; for it is said of <i>Judas</i>, Acts
i. 25. <i>That Judas fell from his Ministry and Apostleship by Transgression</i>; so
his Transgression caused him to cease to be an Apostle any more:
Whereas, had the Apostleship been entailed to his Person, so that
Transgression could not cause him to lose it, until he had been formally
degraded by the <i>Church</i> (which <i>Judas</i> never was so long as he
lived) <i>Judas</i> had been as really an Apostle, after he betrayed Christ,
as before. And as it is of one, so of many, yea, of a whole Church:
For seeing nothing makes a Man truly a Christian, but the Life of
Christianity inwardly ruling in his Heart; so nothing makes a
Church, but the gathering of several true Christians into one Body.
Now where all these Members lose this Life, there the Church ceaseth
to be, though they still uphold the Form, and retain the Name: For
when that which made them a Church, and for which they were a
Church, ceaseth, then they cease also to be a Church: And therefore
the Spirit, speaking to the Church of <i>Laodicea</i>, because of her
<i>Lukewarmness</i>, Rev. iii. 16. threateneth to <i>spue her out of his Mouth</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Lukewarmness of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: he">the</span> Church of </i>Laodicea.</span>Now, suppose the Church of <i>Laodicea</i> had continued in that <i>Lukewarmness</i>,
and had come under that Condemnation and Judgment,
though she had retained the Name and Form of a Church, and had
had her Pastors and Ministers, as no Doubt she had at that Time,
yet surely she had been no true Church of Christ, nor had the Authority
of her Pastors and Teachers been to be regarded, because of
an outward Succession, though perhaps some of them had it immediately
from the Apostles. From all which I infer, That since the
Authority of the Christian Church and her Pastors is always united,
and never separated from the inward Power, Virtue, and righteous
Life of Christianity; where this ceaseth, that ceaseth also. But our
Adversaries acknowledge, <i>That many, if not most of those, by and through
whom they derive this Authority, were altogether destitute of this Life and Virtue
of Christianity: Therefore they could neither receive, have, nor transmit
any Christian Authority</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if it be objected, <i>That though the Generality of the Bishops and

were some good Men among them, whom the Lord regarded, and who were
true Members of the </i>Catholick Church<i> of </i>Christ<i>; might not they then have
transmitted this Authority?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestants<i> plead for a Succession inherent.</i></span>
I answer, This saith nothing; in respect <i>Protestants</i> do not at all
lay Claim to their Ministry, as transmitted to them by a direct Line
of good Men; which they can never shew, nor yet pretend to: But
generally place this Succession as inherent in the whole Pastors of
the Apostate Church. Neither do they plead their Call to be good
and valid, because they can derive it through a Line of good Men,
separate and observably distinguishable from the rest of the Bishops
and Clergy of the <i>Romish Church</i>; but they derive it as an Authority
residing in the Whole: For they think it <i>Heresy</i>, to judge that the
Quality or Condition of the <i>Administrator</i> doth any Ways invalidate
or prejudice his Work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>This vain and pretended Succession not only militates against, and
fights with the very manifest Purpose and Intent of Christ in the gathering
and calling of his Church, but makes him (so to speak) more
blind and less prudent than natural Men are in conveying and establishing
their outward Inheritances.
<span class="sidenote"><i>An Estate void of Heirship devolves to the Prince, none claims it, but whom he sees meet to give it: So the Heirship of Life is enjoyed from Christ, the true Heir.</i></span>For where an Estate is entailed
to a certain Name and Family, when that Family weareth out, and
there is no lawful Successor found of it, that can make a just Title
appear, as being really of Blood and Affinity to the Family; it is
not lawful for any one of another Race or Blood, because he assumes
the Name or Arms of that Family, to possess the Estate, and claim
the Superiorities and Privileges of the Family: But by the Law of
Nations the Inheritance devolves into the Prince, as being <i>Ultimus
Hæres</i>; and so he giveth it again immediately to whom he sees meet,
and makes them bear the Name and Arms of the Family, who then
are entitled to the Privileges and Revenues thereof. So in like Manner,
the true Name and Title of a <i>Christian</i>, by which he hath Right
to the <i>heavenly Inheritance</i>, and is a Member of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, is inward
<i>Righteousness</i> and <i>Holiness</i>, and the Mind redeemed from the <i>Vanities</i>,
<i>Lusts</i>, and <i>Iniquities</i> of this World; and a Gathering or Company,
made up of such Members, makes a Church. Where this is lost, the
Title is lost; and so the true Seed, to which the Promise is, and to
which the Inheritance is due, becomes extinguished in them, and
they become dead as to it: And so it retires, and devolves itself again
into Christ, who is the righteous <i>Heir of Life</i>; and he gives the Title
and true Right again immediately to whom it pleaseth him, even to
as many as being turned to his <i>pure Light</i> in their <i>Consciences</i>, come
again to walk in his <i>righteous</i> and <i>innocent Life</i>, and so become true
Members of his <i>Body</i>, which is the <i>Church</i>. So the Authority, Power
and Heirship are not annexed to Persons, as they bear the mere
Names, or retain a Form, holding the bare Shell or Shadow of <i>Christianity</i>;
but the Promise is to <i>Christ</i>, and to the <i>Seed</i>, in whom the Authority
is inherent, and in as many as are one with him, and united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
unto him by Purity and Holiness, and by the inward Renovation
and Regeneration of their Minds.</p>

<p>Moreover, this pretended Succession is contrary to Scripture Definitions,
and the Nature of the Church of Christ, and of the true
Members.
<span class="sidenote">I. <i>The House of God is no polluted Nest; no </i>Atheist<i> nor </i>Pretender<i> can rest there.</i></span>For, <i>First, The Church is the House of God, the Pillar and
Ground of Truth</i>, 1 Tim. iii. 15. But according to this Doctrine, the
<i>House of God</i> is a polluted Nest of all Sort of Wickedness and Abominations,
made up of the most ugly, defiled, and perverse Stones that
are in the Earth; where the Devil rules in all Manner of Unrighteousness.
For so our Adversaries confess, and History informs, the
<i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i> to have been, as some of their <i>Historians</i> acknowledge;
and if that be truly the <i>House of God</i>, what may we call the <i>House of
Satan</i>? Or may we call it therefore the <i>House of God</i>, notwithstanding
all this Impiety, because they had a bare Form, and that vitiated
many Ways also; and because they pretended to the Name of <i>Christianity</i>,
though they were <i>Antichristian</i>, <i>Devilish</i>, and <i>Atheistical</i> in their
whole Practice and Spirit, and also in many of their Principles?
Would not this infer yet a greater Absurdity, as if they had been
something to be accounted of, because of their Hypocrisy and Deceit,
and false Pretences? Whereas the Scripture looks upon that as
an Aggravation of Guilt, and calls it <i>Blasphemy</i>, Rev. ii. 9. Of two
wicked Men, he is most to be abhorred, who covereth his Wickedness
with a vain Pretence of God and Righteousness: Even so these
<i>abominable Beasts</i>, and <i>fearful Monsters</i>, who looked upon themselves to
be <i>Bishops</i> in the <i>Apostate Church</i>, were never a Whit the better, that
they falsely pretended to be the Successors of the holy Apostles; unless
to lie be commendable, and that Hypocrisy be the Way to Heaven.
Yea, were not this to fall into that Evil condemned among the Jews,
<i>Jer.</i> vii. 4. <i>Trust ye not in lying Words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these; throughly amend your
Ways</i>, &amp;c. as if such outward Names and Things were the Thing the
Lord regarded, and not inward Holiness? Or can that then be the
Pillar and Ground of Truth, which is the very Sink and Pit of Wick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>edness,

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>Christ is the </i>Head<i>, his </i>Body<i> undefiled.</i></span>

Darkness. It is called the </i>Body of Christ<i>, which from him by Joints and

Increase of God</i>, Col. ii. 19. But can such Members, such a Gathering
as we have demonstrated that Church and Members to be, among
whom they allege their pretended Authority to have been preserved,
and through which they derive their Call; can such, I say, be the
Body of Christ, or Members thereof? Or is Christ the Head of such
a corrupt, dead, dark, abominable stinking Carcase? If so, then
might we not as well affirm against the Apostle, 2 <i>Cor.</i> vi. 14.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What Fellowship hath Christ with </i>Belial<i>?</i></span><i>That Righteousness hath Fellowship with Unrighteousness, that Light hath Communion

God to dwell in; and many thus fitted by Christ become his Body,
in and among whom he dwells and walks, according as it is written,
<i>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they
shall be my People</i>. It is therefore that we may become the <i>Temple of

saying out of the Prophet, <a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a><i>Wherefore come out from among them,
and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean Thing, and I
will receive you; and I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and
Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty</i>. But to what Purpose is all this Exhortation?
And why should we separate from the Unclean, if a mere
outward Profession and Name be enough to make the true Church;
and if the Unclean and Polluted were both the Church and lawful
Successors of the Apostles, inheriting their Authority, and transmitting
it to others? Yea, how can the Church be the <i>Kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
the Son of God</i>, as contra-distinguished from the <i>Kingdom and Power
of Darkness</i>? And what Need, yea, what Possibility of being translated
out of the one into the other, if those that make up the Kingdom
and Power of Darkness be real Members of the true Church of
Christ; and not simply Members only, but the very Pastors and
Teachers of it? But how do they <i>increase in the Increase of God, and receive
spiritual Nourishment from Christ the Head</i>, that are Enemies of him
in their Hearts by wicked Works, and openly go into Perdition?
<span class="sidenote">Priests<i> frivolous Distinction of </i>Enemies<i> to God by </i>Practice<i>, and </i>Members<i> of his Church by </i>Office.</span>Verily as no metaphysical and nice Distinctions, that though they
were practically as to their own private States Enemies to God and

the Succession; I say, as such invented and frivolous Distinctions
will not please the Lord God, neither will he be deluded by
such, nor make up the glorious Body of his Church with such mere
outside hypocritical Shews, nor be beholden to such painted Sepulchres
to be Members of his Body, which is found, pure, and undefiled,
and therefore he needs not such false and corrupt Members
to make up the Defects of it; so neither will such Distinctions satisfy
truly tender and Christian Consciences; especially considering the
Apostle is so far from desiring us to regard this, that we are expresly
commanded to <i>turn away from such as have a Form of Godliness, but deny
the Power of it</i>. For we may well object against these, as the poor
Man did against the proud Prelate, that went about to cover his
vain and unchristian-like Sumptuousness, by distinguishing that it
<i>was not as Bishop but as Prince he had all that Splendor</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Answer of a </i>poor Rustick<i> to a </i>proud Prelate.</span>To which the poor Rustic wisely is said to have answered, <i>When the Prince goeth to
Hell, what shall become of the Prelate?</i> And indeed this were to suppose
the Body of Christ to be defective, and that to fill up these defective
Places, he puts counterfeit and dead Stuff instead of real living Members;
like such as lose their Eyes, Arms, or Legs, who make counterfeit
ones of Wood or Glass instead of them. But we cannot think so of
Christ, neither can we believe, for the Reasons above adduced, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
either we are to account, or that Christ doth account, any Man or
Men a Whit the more Members of his Body, because though they
be really wicked, they hypocritically and deceitfully clothe themselves
with his Name, and pretend to it; for this is contrary to his
own Doctrine, where he saith expresly, <i>John</i> xv. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.
That <i>he is the Vine, and his Disciples are the Branches; that except they abide
in him, they cannot bear Fruit; and if they be unfruitful, they shall be cast forth as a Branch, and wither</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A withered Branch can draw no Nourishment, so has no Life nor Virtue.</i></span>Now I suppose these cut and withered Branches are no more true Branches nor Members of the Vine; they
can no more draw Sap nor Nourishment from it, after that they
are cut off, and so have no more Virtue, Sap, nor Life: What have
they then to boast or glory of any Authority, seeing they want that
Life, Virtue, and Nourishment from which all Authority comes?
So such Members of Christ as are become dead to him through Unrighteousness,
and so derive no more Virtue nor Life from him, are
cut off by their Sins, and wither, and have no longer any true or
real Authority, and their boasting of any is but an Aggravation of
their Iniquity by Hypocrisy and Deceit. But further, would not
this make Christ’s Body a mere Shadow and Phantasm? Yea, would
it not make him the Head of a lifeless, rotten, stinking Carcase,
having only some little outward false Shew, while inwardly full of Rottenness and Dirt?
<span class="sidenote"><i>A living Head upon a lifeless Body, what a </i>Monster<i> would that be?</i></span>And what a Monster would these Men make of Christ’s Body, by assigning it a real, pure, living, quick Head,
full of Virtue and Life, and yet tied to such a dead lifeless Body as
we have already described these Members to be, which they allege
to have been the Church of Christ? Again, the Members of the
<i>Church of Christ</i> are specified by this Definition, to wit, as being the
<i>sanctified in Christ Jesus</i>, 1 Cor. i. 2. But this Notion of <i>Succession</i> supposeth
not only some unsanctified Members to be of the <i>Church of
Christ</i>, but even the Whole to consist of unsanctified Members; yea,
that such as were professed <i>Necromancers</i> and open Servants of <i>Satan</i>
were the true Successors of the Apostles, and in whom the Apostolick
Authority resided, these being the Vessels through whom this Succes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>sion
is transmitted; though many of them, as all <i>Protestants</i> and also
some <i>Papists</i> confess, attained these Offices in the (so called) <i>Church</i>
not only by such Means as <i>Simon Magus</i> sought it, but by much
worse, even by Witchcraft, Traditions, Money, Treachery, and
Murder, which <i>Platina</i> himself confesseth<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of divers Bishops of

yet most <i>Protestants</i> begin now to do, distinguish in this Matter, affirming,
<i>That in a great Apostasy, such as was that of the Church of </i>Rome<i>,
God may raise up some singularly by his Spirit, who from the Testimony of the
Scriptures perceiving the Errors into which such as bear the Name of </i>Christians<i>
are fallen, may instruct and teach them, and then become authorized by
the People’s joining with and accepting of their Ministry only.</i> Most of them
also will affirm, <i>That the Spirit herein is subjective, and not objective</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But they say, That <i>where a Church is reformed</i> (such as they pretend
the <i>Protestant</i> Churches are) <i>there an Ordinary orderly Call is necessary;
and that of the Spirit, as extraordinary, is not to be sought after</i>:
Alleging, that <i>Res aliter se habet in ecclesiâ constituendâ, quàm in ecclesiâ
constitutâ</i>; that is, <i>There is a Difference in the constituting of a Church,
and after it is constituted</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>A Difference objected between </i>Constituting<i> a </i>Church<i> and one as </i>Constituted.</span>
I answer, This <i>Objection</i> as to us saith nothing, seeing we accuse,
and are ready from the Scriptures to prove the <i>Protestants</i> guilty of
gross Errors, and needing Reformation, as well as they did and do
the <i>Papists</i>; and therefore we may justly lay Claim, if we would, to
the same extraordinary Call, having the same Reason for it, and as
good Evidence to prove ours as they had for theirs. As for that
Maxim, viz. <i>That the Case is different in constituting a Church, and a Church
constituted</i>, I do not deny it; and therefore there may be a greater
Measure of Power required to the one than to the other, and God
in his Wisdom distributes the same as he sees meet; but that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
same immediate Assistance of the Spirit is not necessary for Ministers
in a gathered Church as well as in gathering one, I see no
solid Reason alleged for it: For surely Christ’s Promise was <i>to be with his</i>
Children <i>to the End of the World</i>, and they need him no less to preserve
and guide his Church and Children than to gather and beget
them. Nature taught the <i>Gentiles</i> this Maxim,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Non minor est virtus, quam quærere, parta tueri.</i>
</p>

<p class="hang">To defend what we attain, requires no less Strength than what is
necessary to acquire it.</p>

<p>For it is by this inward and immediate Operation of the Spirit,
which Christ hath promised <i>to lead his Children </i>with<i> into all Truth</i>, and
to <i>teach them all Things</i>, that Christians are to be led in all Steps, as
well last as first, which relate to <i>God’s Glory</i> and their own <i>Salvation</i>,
as we have heretofore sufficiently proved, and therefore need not
now repeat it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>It is a Device of Satan for Men to put the </i>Spirit’s Leadings<i> far off to former Times.</i></span>And truly this Device of <i>Satan</i>, whereby he has got
People to put the immediate Guidings and Leadings of God’s Spirit
as an extraordinary Thing afar off, which their <i>Forefathers</i> had, but
which they now are neither to wait for nor expect, is a great Cause
of the growing <i>Apostasy</i> upon the many gathered Churches, and is
one great Reason why a dry, dead, barren, lifeless, spiritless Ministry,
which leavens the People into the same Death, doth so much
abound, and is so much overspreading even the <i>Protestant Nations</i>,
that their Preaching and Worships, as well as their whole Conversation,
is not to be discerned from <i>Popish</i> by any fresh living Zeal, or
lively Power of the Spirit accompanying it, but merely by the Difference
of some Notions and Opinions.</p>

Miracles, because we preach no new Gospel, but that which is already confirmed

were, I could say more to this Purpose, but that I study Brevity.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Constitution of the </i>Independent<i> Church.</i></span>There is also another Sort of <i>Protestants</i>, to wit, the <i>English
Independents</i>, who differing from the <i>Calvinistical Presbyterians</i>, and
denying the Necessity of this <i>Succession</i>, or the Authority of any <i>National
Church</i>, take another Way; affirming, <i>That such as have the Benefit
of the Scriptures, any Company of People agreeing in the Principles of
Truth as they find them here declared, may constitute among themselves a

</i>Pastor<i>, who by the </i>Church<i> thus constituted and consenting, is authorized</i>,
requiring only the Assistance and Concurrence of the <i>Pastors</i> of the
neighbouring Churches, if any such there be; not so much as absolutely
necessary to authorize, as decent for Order’s Sake.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Gifted Brethren.</i></span>Also
they go so far as to affirm, <i>That in a </i>Church<i> so constituted, any gifted
Brother, </i>as they call them,<i> if he find himself qualified thereto, may instruct,
exhort, and preach in the </i>Church<i>; though, as not having the </i>Pastoral Office<i>,
he cannot administer those which they call their </i>Sacraments.</div>

<p>To this I answer, That this was a good Step out of the <i>Babylonish
Darkness</i>, and no Doubt did proceed from a real Discovery of the
<i>Truth</i>, and from the Sense of a great Abuse of the promiscuous <i>National
Gatherings</i>. Also this Preaching of the <i>gifted Brethren</i>, as they
called them, did proceed at first from certain <i>lively Touches</i> and <i>Movings</i>
of the Spirit of God upon many; but alas!
<span class="sidenote"><i>Their Loss and Decay.</i></span>because they went
not forward, that is much decayed among them; and the <i>Motions</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
God’s Spirit begin to be denied and rejected among them now, as
much as by others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Scriptures give no Call to Persons </i>Individual.</span>But as to their <i>pretended Call from the Scripture</i>, I answer, The
Scripture gives a mere Declaration of true Things, but no Call to
particular Persons; so that though I believe the Things there written
to be true, and deny the Errors which I find there testified
against, yet as to those Things which may be my particular Duty,
I am still to seek; and therefore I can never be resolved in the Scripture
whether I (such a one by Name) ought to be a Minister? And
for the resolving this Doubt I must needs recur to the inward and
immediate Testimony of the Spirit, as in the Proposition concerning
the <i>Scriptures</i> is shewn more at large.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIV.</h3> From all this then we do firmly conclude, that not only
in a general <i>Apostasy</i> it is needful Men be extraordinarily called, and
raised up by the Spirit of God, but that even when several Assemblies
or Churches are gathered by the Power of God, not only into
the Belief of the Principles of Truth, so as to deny Errors and Heresies,
but also into the Life, Spirit, and Power of Christianity, so
as to be the Body and House of Christ indeed, and a fit Spouse for
him,
<span class="sidenote"><i>True Ministers Qualifications, Call and Title.</i></span>that he who gathers them doth also, for the preserving them in
a lively, fresh, and powerful Condition, raise up and move among
them by the inward immediate Operation of his own Spirit, <i>Ministers</i>
and <i>Teachers</i>, to instruct and teach, and watch over them, who being
thus called, are manifest in the Hearts of their <i>Brethren</i>, and
their Call is thus verified in them, who by the feeling of that Life
and Power that passeth through them, being inwardly builded up by
them daily in the <i>most holy Faith</i>, become the Seals of their <i>Apostleship</i>.
And this is answerable to another Saying of the same Apostle <i>Paul</i>,
2 Cor. xiii. 3.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Their laying on of Hands a Mock to God and Man; a keeping the Shadow, whilst the Substance is wanting.</i></span><i>Since ye seek a Proof of Christ’s Speaking in me, which to
you-wards is not weak, but is mighty in you.</i> So this is that which gives
a <i>true substantial Call</i> and <i>Title</i> to a <i>Minister</i>, whereby he is a real Successor
of the Virtue, Life, and Power that was in the Apostles, and
not of the bare Name: And to such Ministers we think the out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>ward
Ceremony of <i>Ordination</i>; or <i>laying on of Hands</i> not necessary,
neither can we see the Use of it, seeing our Adversaries who use it
acknowledge that the Virtue and Power of communicating the <i>Holy
Ghost</i> by it is ceased among them. And is it not then foolish and ridiculous
for them, by an <i>apish Imitation</i>, to keep up the Shadow,
where the Substance is wanting? And may not they by the same Rule,
where they see blind and lame Men, in Imitation of Christ and his
Apostles, bid them <i>see</i> and <i>walk</i>? Yea, is it not in them a Mocking of
God and Men, to put on their Hands, and bid them <i>receive the Holy
Ghost</i>, while they believe the Thing impossible, and confess that that
<i>Ceremony</i> hath no real Effect? Having thus far spoken of the <i>Call</i>, I shall
proceed next to treat of the <i>Qualifications</i> and <i>Work</i> of a true Minister.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 2. <i>The Qualification of a</i> Minister.</span>
As I have placed the true <i>Call</i> of a <i>Minister</i> in the <i>Motion</i>
of this <i>Holy Spirit</i>, so is the <i>Power</i>, <i>Life</i>, and <i>Virtue</i> thereof, and the
pure <i>Grace of God</i> that comes therefrom, the <i>chief</i> and <i>most necessary
Qualification</i>, without which he can no Ways perform his Duty, neither
acceptably to God nor beneficially to Men.
<span class="sidenote">Philosophy<i> and </i>School-Divinity<i> will never make a </i>Gospel Minister.</span>Our Adversaries
in this Case affirm, that <i>three Things</i> go to the making up of a Minister,
<i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Natural Parts</i>, that he be not a Fool. 2. <i>Acquired Parts</i>,
that he be learned in the Languages, in Philosophy and School Divinity.
3. <i>The Grace of God.</i></div>

<p>The <i>two first</i> they reckon necessary to the Being of a Minister, so
as a Man cannot be one without them; the <i>Third</i> they say goeth to
the Well-being of one, but not to the Being; so that a Man may
truly be a lawful Minister without it, and ought to be heard and
received as such. But we, supposing a natural Capacity, that one
be not an Ideot, judge the <i>Grace of God</i> indispensibly necessary to
the very Being of a Minister, as that without which any can neither
be a true, nor lawful, nor good Minister. As for <i>Letter-learning</i>,
we judge it not so much necessary to the Well-being of one, though
accidentally sometimes in certain Respects it may concur, but more
frequently it is hurtful than helpful,<span class="sidenote"><i>A poor </i>Laick<i> instructed the learned </i>Taulerus.</span> as appeared in the Example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
<i>Taulerus</i>, who being a learned Man, and who could make an eloquent
Preaching, needed nevertheless to be instructed in the Way of
the Lord by a poor <i>Laick</i>.
I shall first speak of the <i>Necessity of Grace</i>,
and then proceed to say something of that Literature which they
judge so needful.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 1.</span><i>First</i> then, as we said in the <i>Call</i>, so may we much more here,
if the <i>Grace of God</i> be a necessary <i>Qualification</i> to make one a <i>true
Christian</i>, it must be a <i>Qualification</i> much more necessary to constitute
a <i>true Minister of Christianity</i>. That <i>Grace</i> is necessary to make one a
<i>true Christian</i> I think will not be questioned, since it is <i>by Grace we
are saved</i>, Ephes. ii. 8.
<span class="sidenote"><i>God’s Grace alone doth constitute a true and lawful </i>Teacher.</span>It is the <i>Grace of God that teacheth us to deny Ungodliness,
and the Lusts of this World, and to live godly and righteously</i>,
Tit. ii. 11. Yea, Christ saith expresly, <i>That without him we can do nothing</i>,
John xv. 5. and the Way whereby Christ helpeth, assisteth,
and worketh with us, is by his <i>Grace</i>: Hence he saith to <i>Paul</i>, <i>My Grace
is sufficient for thee</i>. A Christian without <i>Grace</i> is indeed no Christian,
but an Hypocrite, and a false Pretender. Then I say, <i>If Grace be necessary
to a private Christian, far more to a Teacher among Christians, who must
be as a Father and Instructor of others, seeing this Dignity is bestowed upon such
as have attained a greater Measure than their Brethren. Even </i>Nature<i> itself
may teach as that there is more required in a Teacher than in those that
are taught, and that the Master must be above and before the Scholar in that
Art or Science which he teacheth others. Since then Christianity cannot be
truly enjoyed, neither any Man denominated a Christian without the true Grace
of God, therefore neither can any Man be a true and lawful Teacher of
Christianity without it.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, No Man can be a <i>Minister</i> of the <i>Church</i> of <i>Christ</i>, which
is his <i>Body</i>, unless he be a Member of the <i>Body</i>, and receive of the
Virtue and Life of the <i>Head</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Who first must be a Member of the Body, and then Life is received, and Virtue from the Head.</i></span>
But he that hath not <i>true Grace</i> can neither be a Member of the
<i>Body</i>, neither receive of that Life and Nourishment which comes
from the <i>Head</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore far less can he be a <i>Minister</i> to edify the <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>That he cannot be a Minister, who is not a Member, is evident;
because he who is not a Member is shut out and cut off, and hath
no Place in the <i>Body</i>; whereas the Ministers are counted among the
most eminent Members of the <i>Body</i>. But no Man can be a Member
unless he receive of the Virtue, Life, and Nourishment of the <i>Head</i>;
for the Members that receive not this Life and Nourishment decay
and wither, and then are cut off. And that every true Member doth
thus receive Nourishment and Life from the <i>Head</i>, the Apostle expresly
affirmeth, <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 16. <i>From whom the whole Body being fitly joined
together, and compacted by that which every Joint supplieth, according to the
effectual Working in the Measure of every Part, makes Increase of the Body
unto the Edifying of itself in Love</i>. Now this that thus is communicated,
and which thus uniteth the Whole, is no other than the <i>Grace
of God</i>; and therefore the Apostle in the same Chapter, <i>Ver. 7</i>. saith,
<i>But unto every one of us is given Grace according to the Measure of the Gift
of Christ</i>; and <i>Ver.</i> 11. he sheweth how that <i>by this Grace and Gift both
Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers are given for the Work
of the Ministry, and edifying of the Body of Christ</i>. And certainly then
no Man destitute of Grace is fit for this Work, seeing that all that
Christ gives are so <i>qualified</i>; and these that are not so <i>qualified</i>, are
not given nor sent of Christ, are not to be heard, nor received, nor
acknowledged as <i>Ministers of the Gospel</i>, because his Sheep neither
ought nor will hear the <i>Voice of a Stranger</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Sheep of Christ, neither ought, nor will hear the Stranger’s Voice</i>.</span>This is also clear from
1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. throughout; for the Apostle in that Chapter, treating of
the <i>Diversity of Gifts</i> and <i>Members of the Body</i>, sheweth how by the <i>Workings</i>
of the <i>same Spirit</i> in different <i>Manifestations</i> or <i>Measures</i> in the several
Members of the <i>Body</i> the whole <i>Body</i> is edified, saying, <i>Ver.</i> 13. That
<i>we are all baptized by the one Spirit into one Body</i>; and then, <i>Ver.</i> 28. he
numbers up the several <i>Dispensations</i> thereof, which by God are set in
the Church through the various Workings of his Spirit for the Edification
of the Whole. Then if there be no true Member of the Body
which is not thus baptized by the Spirit, neither any Thing that
worketh to the Edifying of it, but according to a Measure of Grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
received from the Spirit, surely without Grace none ought to be
admitted to work or labour in the Body, because their Labour and
Work, without this Grace and Spirit, would be but ineffectual.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, That this <i>Grace</i> and <i>Gift</i> is a <i>necessary Qualification</i>
to a <i>Minister</i>, is clear from that of the Apostle <i>Peter</i>, 1 Pet. iv. 10, 11.
<i>As every Man hath received the Gift, even so minister the same one to another,
as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. If any Man speak, let him
speak as the Oracles of God: If any Man minister, let him do it as of the Ability
which God giveth; that God in all Things may be glorified through Jesus
Christ; to whom be Praise and Dominion for ever, Amen.</i> From which it
appears, that those that <i>minster</i> must <i>minister</i> according to the <i>Gift</i> and
<i>Grace</i> received; but they that have not such a <i>Gift</i>, cannot <i>minister</i>
according thereunto.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The <span class="correction" title="In the original book: ministring">ministering</span> must be by the Gift and Grace received.</i></span>Secondly, <i>As good Stewards of the manifold
Grace of God</i>: But how can a Man be a <i>good Steward</i> of that which
he hath not? Can ungodly Men, that are not gracious themselves,
be <i>good Stewards</i> of the manifold <i>Grace of God</i>?
<span class="sidenote">Good<i> Stewardship of what? Of </i>God’s abounding Grace<i>, which is the </i>Ability<i> and </i>Stewardship<i> received.</i></span>And therefore in the
following Verses he makes an exclusive Limitation of such that
are not thus furnished, saying, <i>If any Man speak, let <span class="correction" title="In the original book: thim">him</span> speak as the
Oracles of God; and if any Man minister, let him do it as of the Ability that
God giveth</i>: Which is as much as if he had said, they that cannot
thus <i>speak</i>, and thus <i>minister</i>, ought not to do it: For this [<i>If</i>] denotes
a necessary Condition. Now what this <i>Ability</i> is, is manifest
by the former Words, to wit, the <i>Gift</i> received, and the <i>Grace</i>
whereof they are <i>Stewards</i>, as by the immediate Context and Dependency
of the Words doth appear. Neither can it be understood
of a mere natural Ability, because Man in this Condition is said
<i>not to know the Things of God</i>, and so he cannot <i>minister</i> them to others.
And the following Words shew this also, in that he immediately
subjoineth, <i>that God in all Things may be glorified</i>; but surely God is
not glorified, but greatly dishonoured, when natural Men, from
their mere natural Ability, meddle in spiritual Things, which they
neither know nor understand.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, That <i>Grace</i> is a most necessary <i>Qualification</i> for a <i>Minister</i>,
appears by those Qualifications which the Apostle expresly requires,
1 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 2. <i>Tit.</i> i. <i>&amp;c.</i> where he saith, <i>A Bishop must be blameless, vigilant,
sober, of good Behaviour, apt to teach, patient, a Lover of Good Men, just,
holy, temperate, as the Steward of God, holding fast the faithful Word as he
hath been taught</i>. Upon the other Hand, <i>He must neither be given to
Wine, nor a Striker, nor covetous, nor proud, nor self-willed, nor soon
angry</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>How can a </i>Bishop<i> have these Virtues without the </i>Grace of God<i>?</i></span>Now I ask, If it be not impossible that a Man can have all
these above-named Virtues, and be free of all these Evils, without
the <i>Grace of God</i>? If then these Virtues, for the producing of which
in a Man Grace is absolutely necessary, be necessary to make a true
<i>Minister</i> of the Church of Christ according to the Apostle’s Judgment,
surely Grace must be necessary also.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Whatsoever is done in the Church without the Ministry of God’s Spirit, is vain and wicked.</i></span>Concerning this Thing a learned Man, and well skilled in <i>Antiquity</i>,
about the Time of the <i>Reformation</i>, writeth thus: “Whatsoever is done
in the Church, either for Ornament or Edification of Religion, whether
in choosing Magistrates or instituting Ministers of the Church,
except it be done by the Ministry of God’s Spirit, which is as it were
the Soul of the Church, it is vain and wicked. For whoever hath
not been called by the Spirit of God to the great Office of God and
Dignity of Apostleship, as <i>Aaron</i> was, and hath not entered in by
the Door, which is <i>Christ</i>, but hath otherways risen in the Church
by the Window, by the Favours of Men, <i>&amp;c.</i> truly such a one is

<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>Against this absolute Necessity of <i>Grace</i> they object,
<i>That if all Ministers had the saving Grace of God, then all Ministers should be
saved; seeing none can fall away from or lose saving Grace</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But this Objection is built upon a false Hypothesis, purely denied
by us; and we have in the former Proposition concerning <i>Perseverance</i>
already refuted it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, It may be objected to us, <i>That since we affirm that every
Man hath a Measure of true and saving Grace, there needs no singular
Qualification either to a Christian or Minister; for seeing every Man hath this
Grace, then no Man needs forbear to be a Minister for want of Grace</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, We have above shewn that there is necessary to the
making a Minister a <i>special</i> and <i>particular Call</i> from the Spirit of God,
which is something besides the universal Dispensation of <i>Grace</i> to all,
according to that of the Apostle,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> <i>No Man taketh this Honour unto himself,
but he that is called of God</i>, <i>as was</i> Aaron. Moreover, we understand
by <i>Grace</i> as a <i>Qualification</i> to a <i>Minister</i>, not the mere Measure
of <i>Light</i>, as it is given to reprove and call him to Righteousness;
<span class="sidenote"><i>All have God’s Grace, which calls to Righteousness, but all are not so leavened into its Nature as to bring forth Fruits, of a blameless holy Life.</i></span>but we understand <i>Grace</i> as it hath converted the Soul, and operateth
powerfully in it, as hereafter, concerning the <i>Work of Ministers</i>,
will further appear. So we understand not Men simply as
having <i>Grace</i> in them as a <i>Seed</i>, which we indeed affirm <i>all</i> have in
a Measure; but we understand <i>Men</i> that are <i>gracious</i>, leavened by it
into the Nature thereof, so as thereby to bring forth those good
Fruits of a blameless Conversation, and of Justice, Holiness, Pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>tience,
and Temperance, which the Apostle requires as necessary in
a true <i>Christian Bishop</i> and <i>Minister</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But <i>First</i>, As to the <i>false Prophets</i>, there can nothing be more foolish
and ridiculous; as if because there were <i>false Prophets</i>, really <i>false</i>,
without the Grace of God, therefore Grace is not necessary to a true
Christian Minister.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>false<i> not the </i>true Prophets<i> want the Grace of God.</i></span>Indeed if they had proved that <i>true Prophets</i>
wanted this Grace, they had said something; but what have <i>false
Prophets</i> common with <i>true Ministers</i>, but that they pretend falsely
that which they have not? And because <i>false Prophets</i> want true
Grace, will it therefore follow, that <i>true Prophets</i> ought not to have
it, that they may be <i>true</i> and not <i>false</i>? The Example of the <i>Pharisees</i>
and <i>Priests</i> under the <i>Law</i> will not answer to the <i>Gospel Times</i>,
because God set apart a particular <i>Tribe</i> for that Service, and particular
<i>Families</i>, to whom it belonged by a <i>lineal Succession</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Service under the Law was not purely Spiritual, but Figurative; for the Performance of which, as they behoved to be purified from their outward Pollutions: So the Ministers of the </i>Gospel<i> must be inwardly without Blemish</i>.</span>and also
their Service and Work was not purely spiritual, but only the Performance
of some outward and carnal Observations and Ceremonies,
which were but a Shadow of the Substance that was to come;
and therefore their Work <i>made not the Comers thereunto perfect, as appertaining
to the Conscience</i>, seeing they were appointed only according
to the <i>Law of carnal Commandment</i>, and not according to the
<i>Power of an endless Life</i>. Notwithstanding as in the Figure they were
to be <i>without Blemish</i> as to their outward Man, and in the Performance
of their Work they were to be washed and purified from their
outward Pollutions, so now, under the <i>Gospel Times</i>, the <i>Ministers</i> in
the Anti-type must be inwardly <i>without Blemish in their Souls and Spirits</i>,
being, as the Apostle requires, <i>blameless</i>, and in their Work and Service
must be <i>pure</i> and <i>undefiled</i> from their inward Pollutions, and
so <i>clean</i> and <i>holy</i>, <i>that they may offer up spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to
God by Jesus Christ</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 5. As to <i>Judas</i>, the Season of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
<i>Ministry</i> was not wholly Evangelical, as being before the Work was
<i>finished</i>, and while Christ himself and his Disciples were yet subject
to the <i>Jewish Observances</i> and <i>Constitutions</i>, and therefore his Commission,
as well as that which the rest received with him at that
Time, was <i>only to the House of</i> Israel, <i>Matt.</i> x. 5, 6. by Virtue of that
Commission,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ministry of the Disciples of Christ before the Work was finished, was more </i>Legal<i> than </i>Evangelical.</span>therefore the rest of the Apostles were not impowered
to go forth and preach after the Resurrection, until they had waited
at <i>Jerusalem</i> for the pouring forth of the Spirit: So that it appears
<i>Judas’s Ministry</i> was more <i>legal</i> than <i>Evangelical</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Judas<i> was immediately called of Christ, and preached freely, which our Adversaries will not do; although they make him a Pattern of their graceless Ministry, saying, he had not the least Measure of God’s Grace at that Time.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, <i>Judas</i>’s
Case, as all will acknowledge, was singular and extraordinary, he
being <i>immediately called</i> by Christ himself, and accordingly <i>furnished</i>
and <i>impowered</i> by him to preach, and do Miracles; which <i>immediate
Commission</i> our Adversaries do not so much as pretend to, and so fall
short of <i>Judas</i>, who trusted in Christ’s Words, and therefore went
forth and preached, <i>without Gold or Silver, or Scrip for his Journey;
giving freely</i> as he had <i>freely received</i>; which our Adversaries will not
do, as hereafter shall be observed: Also that <i>Judas</i> at that Time had
not the least Measure of God’s Grace, I have not as yet heard
proved. But is it not sad, that even <i>Protestants</i> should lay aside the
eleven good and faithful Apostles, and all the rest of the holy Disciples
and Ministers of Christ, and betake them to that one, of
whom it was testified that he was a <i>Devil</i>, for a Pattern and Example
to their <i>Ministry</i>? Alas! it is to be regretted, that too many
of them resemble this Pattern over-much.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj.</span>Another <i>Objection</i> is usually made against the Necessity of Grace,

<span class="sidenote"><i>What </i>true Learning<i> is.</i></span>Though then we make not <i>Human Learning</i> necessary,
yet we are far from excluding true <i>Learning</i>; to wit, that <i>Learning</i>
which proceedeth from the inward Teachings and Instructions of
the Spirit, whereby the Soul learneth the secret Ways of the Lord,
becomes acquainted with many inward Travails and Exercises of the
Mind; and learneth by a living Experience how to overcome Evil,
and the Temptations of it, by <i>following the Lord</i>, and <i>walking in his
Light</i>, and <i>waiting daily for Wisdom and Knowledge immediately from the
Revelation thereof</i>; and so <i>layeth up</i> these heavenly and divine Lessons
<i>in the good Treasure of the Heart</i>, as honest <i>Mary</i> did the Sayings which
she heard, and Things which she observed: And also out of this
Treasure of the Soul, as the good <i>Scribe</i>, brings forth Things <i>new
and old</i>, according as the same Spirit moves, and gives true Liberty,
and as the Glory of God requires, for whose Glory the Soul, <i>which
is the Temple of God</i>, learneth to do all Things.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The good Learning which is necessary to a true </i>Minister.</span>This is that good

which <i>Learning</i> a Man can well instruct, teach, and admonish in

Gift according as they had received the same, as good Stewards of the manifold
Grace of God</i>; and preached not the uncertain Rumours of Men
by <i>Hearsay</i>, which they had gathered merely in the Comprehension,
while they were Strangers to the Thing in their own Experience in
themselves: As to teach People how to believe, while themselves
were unbelieving, or how to overcome Sin, while themselves are
Slaves to it, as all ungracious Men are; or to believe and hope
for an eternal Reward, which themselves have not as yet arrived
at, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Literature is first the Knowledge of </i>Latin<i>, </i>Greek<i> and </i>Hebrew.</span>But let us examine this <i>Literature</i>, which they make so
necessary to the Being of a <i>Minister</i>; as in the first Place, the Knowledge
of the <i>Tongues</i>, at least of the <i>Latin</i>, <i>Greek</i>, and <i>Hebrew</i>. The
Reason of this is, That they may read the Scripture, which is their
only Rule, in the <i>Original Languages</i>, and thereby be the more capable
to comment upon it, and interpret it, <i>&amp;c.</i> That also which
made this Knowledge be the more prized by the <i>Primitive Protestants</i>,
was indeed the dark Barbarity that was over the World in the <i>Centuries</i>
immediately preceding the Reformation; the Knowledge of
the <i>Tongues</i> being about that Time, (until it was even then restored
by <i>Erasmus</i> and some others) almost lost and extinct.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Before the</i> Reformation <i>the Prayers of the People were in the</i> Latin Tongue.</span>And this Barbarity
was so much the more abominable, that the whole Worship
and Prayers of the People were in the <i>Latin Tongue</i>; and among that
vast Number of <i>Priests</i>, <i>Monks</i> and <i>Friars</i>, scarce one of a Thousand
understood his Breviary, or that Mass which he daily read and repeated:
The Scripture being, not only to the People, but to the
greater Part of the Clergy, even as to the literal Knowledge of it,
as a sealed Book.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Zeal and Endeavours of the first</i> Reformers <i>commended</i>.</span>I shall not at all discommend the Zeal that the
<i>first Reformers</i> had against this <i>Babylonish Darkness</i>, nor their pious Endeavours
to translate the <i>holy Scriptures</i>: I do truly believe, according
to their Knowledge, that they did it candidly:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Knowledge of</i> Languages <i>commendable, and</i> Schools <i>necessary</i>.</span>And therefore
to answer the just Desires of those that desire to read them, and
for other very good Reasons, as maintaining a Commerce and Understanding
among divers Nations by these common Languages,
and others of that Kind, we judge it necessary and commendable
that there be <i>publick Schools</i> for the Teaching and Instructing such
Youth, as are inclinable thereunto, in the Languages. And although
that <i>Papal Ignorance</i> deserved justly to be abhorred and abominated,
we see nevertheless, that the true <i>Reformation</i> consists not in
that Knowledge;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Papists<i> Literature and Knowledge, especially the </i>Jesuits.</span>because although since that Time the <i>Papists</i>, stirred
up through Emulation of the <i>Protestants</i>, have more applied themselves
to Literature, and it now more flourisheth in their <i>Universities</i>
and <i>Cloysters</i>, than before, (especially in the <i>Ignatian</i> or <i>Jesuitick Sect</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
they are as far now as ever from a true <i>Reformation</i>, and more hardened
in their pernicious <i>Doctrines</i>. But all this will not make it a
necessary Qualification to a Minister, far less a more necessary Qualification
than the Grace of God and his Spirit; because the Spirit
and Grace of God can make up this Want in the most Rustick and
Ignorant; but this Knowledge can no Ways make up the Want of
the Spirit in the most Learned and Eloquent.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Spirit is the truest Interpreter of the Scriptures, whether from the </i>Original Languages<i>, or without them.</i></span>For all that which Man,
by his own Industry, Learning and Knowledge in the <i>Languages</i>
can interpret of the Scriptures, or find out, is nothing without the
Spirit; he cannot be certain, but may still miss of the Sense of it:
Whereas a poor Man, that knoweth not a Letter, when he heareth
the Scriptures read, by the same Spirit he can say, <i>This is true</i>; and
by the same Spirit he can understand, open, and interpret it, if
Need be: Yea, finding his Condition to answer the Condition and
Experience of the Saints of old, he knoweth and possesseth the
Truths there delivered, because they are sealed and witnessed in his
own Heart by the same Spirit. And this we have plentiful Experience
of in many of those illiterate Men, whom God hath raised up
to be <i>Ministers</i> in his Church in this Day; so that some such, by
his Spirit, have corrected some of the Errors of the <i>Translators</i>, as in
the Third Proposition concerning the <i>Scriptures</i> I before observed.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A poor </i>Shoemaker<i>, that could not read, refutes a </i>Professor of Divinity’s<i> false Assertions from Scripture.</i></span>Yea, I know myself a poor Shoemaker, that cannot read a Word,
who being assaulted with a false Citation of Scripture, from a publick
Professor of <i>Divinity</i>, before the <i>Magistrate</i> of a City, when he
had been taken up for preaching to some few that came to hear
him; I say, I know such a one, and he is yet alive, who though
the Professor, who also is esteemed a learned Man, constantly asserted
his Saying to be a Scripture Sentence, yet affirmed, not
through any certain Letter-knowledge he had of it, but from the
most <i>certain Evidence of the Spirit in himself</i>, that the <i>Professor</i> was mistaken;
and that the <i>Spirit of God</i> never said any such Thing as the
other affirmed, and the <i>Bible</i> being brought, it was found as the
poor <i>Shoemaker</i> had said.</div>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">2. Logick<i> and </i>Philosophy<i> not needful to a Preacher.</i></span>The second Part of their <i>Literature</i> is <i>Logick</i> and <i>Philosophy</i>,
an Art so little needful to a true Minister, that if one that comes to
be a true Minister hath had it, it is safest for him to forget and
lose it; for it is the Root and Ground of all Contention and Debate,
and the Way to make a Thing a great deal darker, than
clearer. For under the Pretence of regulating Man’s Reason into a
certain Order and Rules, that he may find out (as they pretend)
the Truth, it leads into such a Labyrinth of Contention, as is far
more fit to make a <i>Sceptick</i> than a <i>Christian</i>, far less a Minister of
Christ; yea, it often hinders Man from a clear Understanding of
Things that his own Reason would give him; and therefore through
its manifold Rules and divers Inventions, it often gives Occasion for
a Man, that hath little Reason, foolishly to speak much to no Purpose;
seeing a Man, that is not very wise, may notwithstanding
be a perfect <i>Logician</i>. And then, if ye would make a Man a Fool
to purpose that is not very wise, do but teach him <i>Logick</i> and <i>Philosophy</i>;
and whereas before he might have been fit for something, he
shall then be good for nothing, but to speak Nonsense; for these Notions
will so swim in his Head, that they will make him extremely
busy about nothing.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Use of </i>Logick<i> is to see its Emptiness.</i></span>The Use that wise and solid Men make of it,
is, to see the Emptiness thereof; therefore saith one, <i>It is an Art of
Contention and Darkness, by which all other Sciences are rendered more obscure,
and harder to be understood</i>.</div>

<p>If it be urged, <i>That thereby the Truth may be maintained and confirmed,
and Hereticks confuted</i>;</p>

<p>I answer, The Truth, in Men truly rational, needeth not the Help
thereof; and such as are obstinate, this will not convince; for by
this they may learn twenty Tricks and Distinctions, how to shut
out the Truth: And the Truth proceeding from an honest Heart,
and spoken forth from the Virtue and Spirit of God, will have more
Influence, and take sooner and more effectually, than by a thousand
Demonstrations of <i>Logick</i>; as that <i>Heathen Philosopher</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a><a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> acknowledged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
who, disputing with the <i>Christian Bishops</i>, in the <i>Council</i> of <i>Nice</i>, was
so subtile, that he could not be overcome by them; but yet by a
few Words spoken by a simple old <i>Rustick</i>, was presently convinced
by him, and converted to the Christian Faith; and being enquired
how he came to yield to that ignorant old Man, and not to the
Bishops; he said, <i>That they contended with him in his own Way, and he
could still give Words for Words; but there came from the old Man that Virtue,
which he was not able to resist</i>. This <i>secret Virtue</i> and <i>Power</i> ought
to be the <i>Logick</i> and <i>Philosophy</i> wherewith a true Christian Minister
should be furnished; and for which they need not be beholden to
<i>Aristotle</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Natural Logick <i>useful</i>.</span>As to <i>natural Logick</i>, by which rational Men, without that
Art and Rules, or sophistical Learning, deduce a certain Conclusion
out of true Propositions, which scarce any Man of Reason wants,
we deny not the Use of it; and I have sometimes used it in this
Treatise; which also may serve without that <i>dialectick Art</i>.
<span class="sidenote">3. Ethicks<i> or the </i>Manner-Rules<i> to Christians not needful.</i></span>As for
the other Part of <i>Philosophy</i>, which is called <i>Moral</i>, or <i>Ethicks</i>, it is
not so necessary to Christians, who have the Rules of the holy
Scriptures, and the Gift of the Holy Spirit, by which they can be
much better instructed.
<span class="sidenote">4. Physicks, <i>and the</i> Metaphysicks <i>make no Preachers of the</i> Truth.</span>The <i>Physical</i> and <i>Metaphysical</i> Part may be
reduced to the Arts of <i>Medicine</i> and the <i>Mathematicks</i>, which have
nothing to do with the Essence of a <i>Christian Minister</i>. And therefore
the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, who well understood what was good for
Christian Ministers, and what hurtful, thus exhorted the <i>Colossians</i>,
Col. ii. 8. <i>Beware lest any Man spoil you through Philosophy and vain Deceit.</i>
And to his beloved Disciple <i>Timothy</i> he writes also thus,
1 <i>Tim.</i> vi. 20. <i>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy Trust, avoiding
profane and vain Babblings, and Opposition of Science, falsely so
called.</i></p>

the <i>Heathenish Terms</i> and <i>Maxims</i>; being, as it were, the <i>Heathenish

devilish Wisdom, pleasing himself with some Notions of Truth, and
adorning them with his own sensual and carnal Wisdom, because he
thinks the Simplicity of the Truth too low and mean a Thing for
him; and so despiseth that Simplicity, wheresoever it is found, that
he may set up and exalt himself, puffed up with this his monstrous
Birth. It is the Devil, darkening, obscuring, and veiling the
Knowledge of God, with his serpentine and worldly Wisdom; that
so he may the more securely deceive the Hearts of the Simple, and
make the Truth, as it is in itself, despicable and hard to be
known and understood, by multiplying a thousand difficult and
needless Questions, and endless Contentions and Debates. All
which, he who perfectly knoweth, is not a Whit less the Servant of
Sin than he was; but ten Times more so, in that he is exalted, and
proud of Iniquity, and so much the farther from receiving, understanding,
or learning the Truth, as it is in its own naked Simplicity;
because he is full, learned, rich, and wise in his own Conceit:
And so those that are most skilled in it, wear out their Day,
and spend their precious Time about the infinite and innumerable
Questions they have feigned and invented concerning it. A certain
learned Man called it, <i>A twofold Discipline, like the Race of the
Centaurs, partly proceeding from divine Sayings, partly from philosophical
Reasons</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Its needless Questions and endless Janglings.</i></span>A thousand of their Questions they confess themselves to
be no-ways necessary to Salvation; and yet many more of them
they could never agree upon, but are, and still will be, in endless
Janglings about them. The Volumes that have been written about
it, a Man in his whole Age could scarce read, though he lived to
be very old; and when he has read them all, he has but wrought
himself a great deal more Vexation and Trouble of Spirit than he
had before. These certainly are the <i>Words multiplied without Knowledge;
by which Counsel hath been darkened</i>, Job xxxviii. 2. They make
the Scripture the Text of all this Mass; and it is concerning the
Sense of it that their voluminous Debates arise. But a Man of a
good upright Heart may learn more in half an Hour, and be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
certain of it, by waiting upon <i>God</i>, and his <i>Spirit in the Heart</i>, than
by reading a thousand of their Volumes; which by filling his Head
with many needless Imaginations, may well stagger his Faith, but
never confirm it: And indeed those that give themselves most to it,
are most capable to fall into Error, as appeareth by the Example
of <i>Origen</i>, who, by his Learning, was one of the first, that falling
into this Way of interpreting the Scriptures, wrote so many Volumes,
and in them so many Errors, as very much troubled the
Church.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whereby </i>Arius<i> fell into Error and Schism.</i></span>Also <i>Arius</i>, led by this Curiosity and human Scrutiny,
despising the Simplicity of the Gospel, fell into his <i>Error</i>, which
was the Cause of that horrible Heresy which so much troubled the
Church. Methinks the Simplicity, Plainness, and Brevity of the
Scriptures themselves, should be a sufficient Reproof for such a
Science; and the Apostles, being honest, plain, illiterate Men, may
be better understood by such Kind of Men now, than with all that
Mass of scholastick Stuff, which neither <i>Peter</i>, nor <i>Paul</i>, nor <i>John</i>,
ever thought of.</div>

<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Apostasy<i>, and its dangerous </i>Consequence.</span>But this Invention of Satan, wherewith he began the
<i>Apostasy</i>, hath been of dangerous Consequence; for thereby he at
first spoiled the Simplicity of Truth, by keeping up the <i>Heathenish
Learning</i>, which occasioned such Uncertainty, even among those
called <i>Fathers</i>, and such Debate, that there are few of them to be found,
who, by Reason of this Mixture, do not only frequently contradict
one another, but themselves also.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Many of the </i>Fathers<i> do not only contradict each other, but themselves also, and why?</i></span>And therefore when the <i>Apostasy</i>
grew greater, he, as it were, buried the Truth with this Veil of
Darkness, wholly shutting out People from true Knowledge, and
making the Learned (so accounted) busy themselves with idle and
needless Questions; while the weighty Truths of God were neglected,
and went, as it were, into Disuse.</div>

<p>Now, though the grossest of these Abuses be swept away by <i>Protestants</i>;
yet the evil Root still remains, and is nourished and upheld;
and the Science kept up, as being deemed necessary for a Minister:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
For, while the pure Learning of the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>Truth</i> is despised and
neglected, and made ineffectual, Man’s fallen earthly Wisdom is
upheld; and so in that he labours and works with the <i>Scriptures</i>, being
out of the <i>Life</i> and <i>Spirit</i> which those that wrote them were in,
by which only they are rightly understood, and made Use of.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Merchandizing with the Scriptures: What it is. See also </i>2 Pet. 2. 3.</span>And
so he that is to be a Minister, must learn this <i>Art</i> or <i>Trade</i> of <i>Merchandizing</i>
with the <i>Scriptures</i>, and be that which the Apostle would
not be, to wit, a <i>Trader with them</i>, 2 Cor. ii. 17. That he may acquire
a Knack from a Verse of Scripture, by adding his own barren
Notions and Conceptions to it, and his uncertain Conjectures, and
what he hath stolen out of Books; for which End he must have of
Necessity a good many by him, and may each <i>Sabbath-day</i>, as they
call it, or oftener, make a Discourse for an Hour long;
<span class="sidenote"><i>And this they call the </i>Preaching<i> of the </i>Word.</span>and this is
called the <i>Preaching of the Word</i>: Whereas the Gift, Grace, and Spirit
of God, to teach, open, and instruct, and to preach a Word in
Season, is neglected, and so Man’s Arts and <i>Parts</i>, and <i>Knowledge</i>,
and <i>Wisdom</i>, which is <i>from below</i>, are set up and established in the
Temple of God, yea, and above the little <i>Seed</i>; which in Effect is
<i>Antichrist</i>, working in the Mystery.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Thus </i>Antichrist<i> is established above the Seed of the Kingdom.</i></span>And so the Devil may be as good
and able a Minister as the best of them;
<span class="sidenote"><i>How the Devil may be a </i>Minister<i> of the Priests Gospel.</i></span>for he has better Skill in <i>Languages</i>,
and more <i>Logick</i>, <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>School Divinity</i>, than any of them;
and knows the Truth in the Notion better than they all, and can
talk more eloquently than all those Preachers. But what availeth
all this; Is it not all but as Death, as a painted Sepulchre, and dead
Carcase, without the Power, Life and Spirit of Christianity, which
is the Marrow and Substance of a <i>Christian Ministry</i>? And he that
hath this, and can speak from it, though he be a poor Shepherd, or
a Fisherman, and ignorant of all that Learning, and of all those
Questions and Notions; yet speaking from the Spirit, his Ministry
will have more Influence towards the converting a Sinner unto God,
than all of them who are learned after the Flesh; as in that Example
of the old Man at the <i>Council</i> of <i>Nice</i> did appear.</p>

eighteen Years of Age;

<span class="sidenote">Quest. 3. <i>The Work of a Minister.</i></span>
Having thus spoken of the <i>Call</i> and <i>Qualifications</i> of a <i>Gospel-Minister</i>,
that which comes next to be considered, is, <i>What his
proper Work is, how, and by what Rule, he is to be ordered</i>? Our Adversaries
do all along go upon <i>Externals</i>, and therefore have certain prescribed
Rules and Methods, contrived according to their human
and earthly Wisdom: We, on the Contrary, walk still upon the
same <i>Foundation</i>, and lean always upon the immediate Assistance and
Influence of that <i>Holy Spirit</i>, which God hath given his <i>Children</i>, to teach
them all Things, and lead them in all Things:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Holy Spirit, a Spirit of Order, and not of Confusion.</i></span>Which <i>Spirit</i>, being
the <i>Spirit of Order</i>, and not of <i>Confusion</i>, leads us, and as many as
follow it, into such a <i>comely</i> and <i>decent Order</i> as becometh the Church
of God. But our Adversaries, having shut themselves out from this
immediate Counsel and Influence of the Spirit, have run themselves
into many Confusions and Disorders, seeking to establish an
Order in this Matter.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Popish Orders and Offices</i>, &amp;c.</span>For some will have <i>First</i> a <i>chief Bishop</i>, or
<i>Pope</i>, to rule and be a Prince over all; and under him, by Degrees,
<i>Cardinals</i>, <i>Patriarchs</i>, <i>Archbishops</i>, <i>Priests</i>, <i>Deacons</i>, <i>Sub-deacons</i>; and besides
these, <i>Acoluthi</i>, <i>Tonsorati</i>, <i>Ostiarii</i>, &amp;c. And in their <i>Theology</i> (as
they call it) <i>Professors</i>, <i>Bachelors</i>, <i>Doctors</i>, &amp;c. And others would
have every Nation <i>independent</i> of another, having its own <i>Metropolitan</i>
or <i>Patriarch</i>; and the rest in Order subject to him, as before.
Others again are against all <i>Precedency</i> among <i>Pastors</i>, and constitute
their <i>Subordination</i> not of Persons, but of Powers: As first the <i>Consistory</i>,
or <i>Session</i>; then the <i>Class</i>, or <i>Presbytery</i>; then the <i>Provincial</i>; and
then the <i>National Synod</i> or <i>Assembly</i>. Thus they <i>tear one another</i>, and
contend among themselves concerning the Ordering, Distinguishing,
and making their several Orders and Offices;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Wars and Bloodshed about </i>Church Government.</span>concerning which there
hath been no less Contest, not only by Way of verbal Dispute, but
even by Fighting, Tumults, Wars, Devastations, and Bloodshed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
than about the Conquering, Overturning, and Establishing of Kingdoms.
And the <i>Histories</i> of late Times are as full of the various
<i>Tragedies</i>, acted on Account of this <i>Spiritual</i> and <i>Ecclesiastical Monarchy</i>
and <i>Commonwealth</i>, as the <i>Histories</i> of old Times are of the Wars and
Contests that fell out both in the <i>Assyrian</i>, <i>Persian</i>, <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i>
Empires: These last upon this Account, though among those that
are called <i>Christians</i>, have been no less bloody and cruel than the
former among <i>Heathens</i>, concerning their outward Empires and Governments.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ground and Cause thereof</i>.</span>Now all this, both among <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, proceedeth,
in that they seek in Imitation to uphold a Form and Shadow
of Things, though they want the Power, Virtue and Substance;
while for many of their Orders and Forms they have not so much
as the Name in the Scripture. But in Opposition to all this Mass
of Formality, and Heap of Orders, Rules and Governments, we
say, <i>The Substance is chiefly to be sought after, and the Power, Virtue and
Spirit, is to be known and waited for, which is one</i> in all the different
Names and Offices the Scripture makes Use of; as appears by 1 <i>Cor.</i>
xii. 4. (often before-mentioned) <i>There are Diversities of Gifts, but the
same Spirit</i>. And after the Apostle, throughout the whole Chapter,
hath shewn how one and the self-same Spirit worketh in and quickeneth
each Member; then in <i>Ver.</i> 28. he sheweth how thereby God
hath set in the Church, First <i>Apostles</i>, Secondly <i>Prophets</i>, <i>Teachers</i>, &amp;c.
And likewise to the same Purpose, <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 11; he sheweth, how by
these Gifts <i>he hath given some Apostles</i>, <i>some Prophets</i>, <i>some Evangelists</i>,
<i>some Pastors</i>, <i>some Teachers</i>, &amp;c. Now it never was Christ’s Purpose,
nor the Apostles, that <i>Christians</i> should, without this Spirit and Heavenly
Gift, set up a Shadow and Form of these Orders, and so make
several Ranks and Degrees, to establish a <i>carnal Ministry</i> of Men’s
making, without the Life, Power and Spirit of Christ:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Work of Antichrist and Mystery of Iniquity.</i></span>This is that
<i>Work</i> of <i>Antichrist</i>, and <i>Mystery</i> of <i>Iniquity</i>, that hath got up in the
dark Night of Apostasy. But in a true <i>Church of Christ</i>, gathered together
by God, not only into the Belief of the <i>Principles of Truth</i>,
but also into the Power, Life and Spirit of <i>Christ</i>, the Spirit of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
is the Orderer, Ruler and Governor; as in each Particular, so in
the General.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Such as the Spirit sets apart to the </i>Ministry<i>, their Brethren hear them.</i></span>And when they assemble together to wait upon God,
and to worship and adore him; then such as the Spirit sets apart
for the <i>Ministry</i>, by its divine Power and Influence opening their
Mouths, and giving them to exhort, reprove, and instruct with
Virtue and Power; these are thus ordained of God and admitted
into the <i>Ministry</i>, and their Brethren cannot but hear them, receive
them, and also <i>honour them for their Work’s Sake</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Clergy and Laicks.</i></span>And so this is not
<i>monopolized</i> by a certain Kind of Men, as the <i>Clergy</i> (who are to that
Purpose educated and brought up as other carnal <i>Artists</i>) and the
rest to be despised as <i>Laicks</i>; but it is left to the <i>free Gift of God</i> to
choose any whom he seeth meet thereunto, whether Rich or Poor,
Servant or Master, Young or Old, yea, Male or Female.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Women may preach.</i></span>And such
as have this Call, verify the Gospel, by <i>preaching not in Speech only,
but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much Fulness</i>, 1 Thess. i. 5.
and cannot but be received and heard by the <i>Sheep of Christ</i>.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if it be objected here, <i>That I seem hereby to make no
Distinction at all betwixt Ministers and others; which is contrary to the
Apostle’s Saying</i>, 1 Cor. xii. 29. <i>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are
all Teachers?</i> &amp;c. From thence they insinuate, <i>That I also contradict
his Comparison in that Chapter, of the Church of Christ with a human Body</i>;
as where he saith, Ver. 17. <i>If the whole Body were an Eye, where were
the Hearing? If the Whole were Hearing, where were the Smelling?</i> &amp;c.
<i>Also the Apostle not only distinguisheth the Ministers of the Church in general
from the rest of the Members, but also from themselves; as naming them distinctly
and separately, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1. Diversity of Names makes no distinct Offices; but which may coincide, or be together in one Person.</i></span>As to the last Part of this Objection, to which I shall first answer;
it is apparent, that this Diversity of Names is not to distinguish
separate Offices, but to denote the different and various
Operations of the Spirit; a Manner of Speech frequent with the
Apostle <i>Paul</i>, wherein he sometimes expatiates to the Illustrating of
the Glory and Praise of God’s Grace: As in Particular, <i>Rom.</i> xii. 6.
<i>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given us, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
Prophecy, let us prophesy according to the Proportion of Faith; or Ministry,
let us wait on our Ministring; or he that teacheth, on Teaching; or he that
exhorteth, on Exhortation.</i> Now none will say from all this, that these
are <i>distinct Offices</i>, or do not, or may not coincide in one Person, as
may all those other Things mentioned by him in the subsequent
Verses, viz. <i>Of Loving</i>, <i>being kindly Affectionated</i>, <i>Fervency of Spirit</i>, <i>Hospitality</i>,
<i>Diligence</i>, <i>Blessing</i>, <i>Rejoicing</i>, &amp;c. which he yet numbers forth as
different Gifts of the Spirit, and according to this Objection might be
placed as distinct and separate Offices, which were most absurd.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, In these very Places mentioned it is clear that it is no
real Distinction of separate Offices; because all acknowledge, that
<i>Pastors</i> and <i>Teachers</i>, (which the Apostle there no less separateth and
distinguisheth, than <i>Pastors</i> and <i>Prophets</i>, or <i>Apostles</i>) are one and the
same, and coincide in the same <i>Office</i> and <i>Person</i>; and therefore may
be said so of the rest.
<span class="sidenote">Prophecy<i> and </i>Prophesying<i>, its twofold Signification.</i></span>For [<i>Prophecy</i>] as it signifies the <i>Foretelling of
Things to come</i>, is indeed a distinct Gift, but no distinct Office; and
therefore our Adversaries do not place it among their several Orders:
Neither will they deny, but that it both may be and hath been
given of God to some, that not only have been <i>Pastors</i> and <i>Teachers</i>,
and that there it hath coincided in one Person with these other Offices,
but also to some of the <i>Laicks</i>: And so it hath been found, according
to their own Confession, without the Limits of their <i>Clergy</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>To</i> prophesy, <i>a Privilege of</i> Teachers, <i>and of all the</i> Saints.</span><i>Prophecy</i> in the other Sense, to wit, as it signifies a <i>Speaking from the
Spirit of Truth</i>, is not only peculiar to <i>Pastors</i> and <i>Teachers</i>, who ought
so to <i>prophesy</i>; but even a common Privilege to the <i>Saints</i>. For
though to instruct, teach and exhort, be proper to such as are more
particularly called to the Work of the <i>Ministry</i>; yet it is not so proper
to them, as not to be (when the Saints are met together, as any of
them are moved by the Spirit) common to others: For some Acts
belong to all in such a Relation; but not only to those within that
Relation: <i>Competunt omni, sed non soli</i>. Thus to <i>see</i> and <i>hear</i> are proper
Acts of a Man; seeing it may be properly predicated of him,
that he <i>heareth</i> and <i>seeth</i>: Yet are they common to other Creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
also. So to <i>prophesy</i> in this Sense, is indeed proper to <i>Ministers</i> and
<i>Teachers</i>; yet not so, but that it is common and lawful to other
<i>Saints</i>, when moved thereunto, though it be not proper to them by
Way of Relation: Because, notwithstanding that Motion, they are
not particularly called to the Work of the <i>Ministry</i>, as appears by
1 <i>Cor.</i> xiv. where the Apostle at large declaring the Order and ordinary
Method of the Church, saith, Ver. 30, 31. <i>But if</i> any Thing
<i>be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his Peace; for ye may
all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all be comforted</i>: Which
sheweth that none is here excluded. But yet that there is a <i>Subordination</i>,
according to the various Measures of the Gift received, the
next Verse sheweth: <i>And the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the
Prophets: For God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace</i>. Now
that <i>Prophesying</i>, in this Sense, may be <i>common to all Saints</i>, appears
by Ver. 39. of the same Chapter, where speaking to [<i>all</i>] in general,
he saith, <i>Wherefore, Brethren, covet to prophesy</i>; and Ver. 1. he exhorts
them, saying, <i>Desire spiritual Gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Who are </i>Evangelists<i>, and whether any may term themselves so now-a-day.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, As to <i>Evangelists</i> the same may be said; for whoever
preacheth the <i>Gospel</i> is really an <i>Evangelist</i>, and so consequently every
true <i>Minister</i> of the <i>Gospel</i> is one; else what proper Office can they
assign to it, unless they should be so foolish as to affirm that none
were <i>Evangelists</i> but <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i>, <i>Luke</i>, and <i>John</i>, who wrote the
Account of Christ’s Life and Sufferings? And then it were neither
a particular Office, seeing <i>John</i> and <i>Matthew</i> were Apostles, <i>Mark</i> and
<i>Luke</i> Pastors and Teachers, so that there they coincided in one.
And indeed it is absurd to think, that upon that particular Account
the Apostle used the Word [<i>Evangelist</i>.] <i>Calvin</i> acknowledgeth,
that <i>such as preach the Gospel in Purity, after some Time of Apostasy, may be
truly called </i>Evangelists, and therefore saith, that <i>There were Apostles in
his Time</i>; and hence the <i>Protestants</i>, at their first coming forth, termed
themselves <i>Evangelici</i>, or <i>Evangelicks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Who is an </i>Apostle.</span><i>Lastly</i>, An <i>Apostle</i>, if we look to the Etymology of the Word, signifies
<i>one that is sent</i>; and in Respect <i>every true Minister is sent of God</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
so far he is an <i>Apostle</i>; though the <i>Twelve</i>, because of their being <i>specially
sent of Christ</i>, were therefore called <i>Apostles</i> [Greek: kat' exochên: κατ εξοχην], or <i>per eminentiam</i>,
i. e. by Way of Excellency.
<span class="sidenote"><i>They were not limited to such a Number.</i></span>And yet that there was no
Limitation to such a Number, as some foolishly imagine, appears,
because after that Number was filled up, the Apostle <i>Paul</i> was afterwards
so called; therefore we judge that these are no distinct separate
Offices, but only Names used upon Occasion to express the
more eminent Arising and Shining forth of <i>God’s Grace</i>. As if any
<i>Minister</i> of <i>Christ</i> should now proselyte and turn a whole Nation to
the <i>Christian Faith</i>, though he had no distinct Office, yet I doubt
not but both <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> would judge it tolerable to call
such an one an <i>Apostle</i>, or an <i>Evangelist</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether any Man be called an </i>Apostle<i> at this Day</i>.</span>for on this Account the <i>Jesuits</i>
call some of their Sect <i>Apostles</i> of <i>India</i> and of <i>Japan</i>; and <i>Calvin</i>
testifies that there were <i>Apostles</i> and <i>Evangelists</i> in his Time, in respect
to the <i>Reformation</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Upon what Account </i>John Knox<i> was called the </i>Apostle<i> of </i>Scotland.</span>upon which Account also we have known
<i>John Knox</i> often called the <i>Apostle</i> of <i>Scotland</i>. So that we conclude
that <i>Ministers</i>, <i>Pastors</i>, or <i>Teachers</i> do comprehend <i>all</i>, and that the
Office is but <i>one</i>, and therefore in that Respect we judge there ought
to be no Precedency among them: To prove which I shall not here
insist, seeing it is shewn largely, and treated of by such as have denied
the <i>Diocesan Episcopacy</i>, as they call it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 2.</i></span>As to the first Part of the <i>Objection</i>, viz. <i>That I seem to
make no Distinction betwixt the Minister and People</i>, I answer,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Liberty to </i>prophesy<i> all have, by the Spirit.</i></span>If it be
understood of a Liberty to <i>speak</i> or <i>prophesy</i> by the <i>Spirit</i>, I say all
may do that, when moved thereunto, as above is shewn; but we
do believe and affirm that some are more particularly called to the
Work of the <i>Ministry</i>, and therefore are fitted of the Lord for that
Purpose; whose Work is more constantly and particularly to instruct,
exhort, admonish, oversee, and watch over their Brethren; and
that as there is something more incumbent upon them in that Respect
than upon every common Believer, so also, as in that Relation,
there is due to them from the Flock such Obedience and Subjection
as is mentioned in these Testimonies of the Scripture, <i>Heb.</i> xiii. 17.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
1 <i>Thess.</i> v. 12, 13. 1 <i>Tim.</i> v. 17. 1 <i>Pet.</i> v. 5. Also besides these who are
thus particularly called to the <i>Ministry</i>, and constant Labour in the
Word and Doctrine, there are also the <i>Elders</i>, who though they be not
moved to a frequent Testimony by Way of Declaration in Words,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Elders take Care for the </i>Widows<i>, the </i>Poor<i> and </i>Fatherless.</span>yet as such are grown up in the Experience of the blessed Work of
Truth in their Hearts, they watch over and privately admonish the
Young, take Care for the Widows, the Poor, and Fatherless, and
look that nothing be wanting, but that Peace, Love, Unity, Concord,
and Soundness be preserved in the <i>Church of Christ</i>; and this
answers to the <i>Deacons</i> mentioned <i>Acts</i> vi.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Distinction of </i>Clergy<i> and </i>Laity<i> not to be found in Scripture.</i></span>That which we oppose, is the Distinction of <i>Laity</i> and <i>Clergy</i>,
which in the Scripture is not to be found, whereby none are admitted
unto the Work of the <i>Ministry</i> but such as are educated at
<i>Schools</i> on Purpose, and instructed in <i>Logick</i> and <i>Philosophy</i>, &amp;c. and
so are at their Apprenticeship to learn the <i>Art</i> and <i>Trade</i> of <i>Preaching</i>,
even as a Man learns any other <i>Art</i>, whereby all other honest
<i>mechanick Men</i>, who have not got this <i>Heathenish Art</i>, are excluded
from having this Privilege. And so he that is a <i>Scholar</i> thus bred
up must not have any honest Trade whereby to get him a Livelihood,
if he once intend for the <i>Ministry</i>, but he must see to get
him a Place, and then he hath his <i>set Hire</i> for a <i>Livelihood</i> to him.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Their Garb.</i></span>He must also be distinguished from the rest by the Colour of his
Clothes; for he must only wear <i>Black</i>, and must be a <i>Master of Arts</i>:
But more of this hereafter.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVII.</h3> As this Manner of separating Men for the <i>Ministry</i> is
nothing like the Church in the Apostles Days, so great Evils have
and do follow upon it. For first, Parents seeing both the Honour
and Profit that attends the <i>Clergy</i>, do allot their Children sometimes
from their Infancy to it, and so breed them up on Purpose. And
others, come to Age, upon the same Account betake them to the
same Trade, and having these natural and acquired Parts that are
judged the necessary Qualifications of a <i>Minister</i>, are thereby admitted,
and so are bred up in Idleness and Pleasure, thinking it a Dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>grace
for them to work with their Hands;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Clergy’s Study out of Books; the Gift of God neglected.</i></span>and so just study a little
out of their Books, to make a Discourse once or twice a Week during
the running of an Hour-glass; whereas the Gift, Grace, and Spirit
of God, to call and qualify for the <i>Ministry</i>, is neglected and overlooked.
And many <i>covetous</i>, <i>corrupt</i>, <i>earthly</i>, <i>carnal</i> Men, having a
mere Shew and Form, but Strangers to, and utterly ignorant of, the
inward Work <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: and">of</span> Grace upon their Hearts, are brought in and intrude
themselves, and so through them Death, Barrenness, and Darkness,
and by Consequence Superstition, Error, and Idolatry have
entered and leavened the <i>Church</i>. And they that will narrowly observe,
shall find that it was thus the <i>Apostasy</i> came to take Place; of
the Truth of which I could give many Examples, which for Brevity’s
Sake I omit. Thus the Office, Reverence, and Respect due to it
were annexed to the mere Name, so that when once a Man was ordained
a <i>Bishop</i> or a <i>Priest</i>, he was heard and believed, though he had
nothing of the Spirit, Power, and Life that the true <i>Apostles</i> and <i>Ministers</i>
were in. And thus in a short Time the Succession came to be
of the Name and Title, and the Office was thereto annexed; and not
of the Nature, Virtue, and Life; which in Effect made them to cease
to be the <i>Ministry</i> and <i>Ministers</i> of <i>Christ</i>, but only a Shadow and vain
Image of it; which also decaying, was in some Ages so metamorphosed,
that not only the Substance was lost, but the very Form
wholly vitiated, altered, and marred;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The marred Church compared to </i>Theseus<i>’s pieced Boat.</i></span>so that it may be far better
said of the pretended <i>Christian Church</i>, as was disputed of <i>Theseus</i>’s
Boat (which by the piecing of many new Pieces of Timber was wholly
altered) <i>whether indeed it were the same or another</i>? But in Case that the
first had been of <i>Oak</i>, and the Pieces last put in but of rotten <i>Fir</i>,
and that also the Form had been so far changed as to be nothing
like the first, I think it would have suffered no Dispute, but might
have easily been concluded to be quite another, retaining nothing
but the Name, and that also unjustly.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Abuse following the Distinction of </i>Laity<i> and </i>Clergy.</span><i>Secondly</i>, From this Distinction
of <i>Laity</i> and <i>Clergy</i> this Abuse also follows, that <i>good</i>, <i>honest</i>, <i>mechanick
Men</i>, and others who have not learned the Art and Trade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
Preaching, and so are not licentiated according to these Rules they
prescribe unto themselves; such, I say, being possessed with a false
Opinion that it is not lawful for them to meddle with the <i>Ministry</i>,
nor that they are any Ways fit for it, because of the Defect of that
Literature, do thereby neglect the Gift in themselves, and quench
many Times the <i>pure Breathings of the Spirit of God</i> in their Hearts;
which, if given Way to, might prove much more for the Edification
of the Church than many of the <i>conned Sermons</i> of the Learned. And
so by this Means the Apostle’s Command and Advice is slighted,
who exhorteth, 1 <i>Thess.</i> v. 19, 20. <i>not to quench the Spirit, nor despise
Prophesyings</i>. And all this is done by Men pretending to be <i>Christians</i>,
who glory that the first <i>Preachers</i> and <i>Propagators</i> of their <i>Religion</i>
were such Kind of plain mechanick Men, and illiterate.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Both </i>Protestants<i> and </i>Papists<i> exclude mechanick Men from preaching, who greatly contributed to the Reformation.</i></span>And even <i>Protestants</i>
do no less than <i>Papists</i> exclude such Kind of Men from being
<i>Ministers</i> among them, and thus limit the Spirit and Gift of God;
though their <i>Fathers</i>, in Opposition to <i>Papists</i>, asserted the Contrary;
and also their own <i>Histories</i> declare how that Kind of illiterate Men
did, without Learning, by the Spirit of God, greatly contribute in
divers Places to the <i>Reformation</i>.</div>

<p>By this it may appear, that as in <i>Calling</i> and <i>Qualifying</i>, so in
<i>Preaching</i> and <i>Praying</i>, and the other particular Steps of the <i>Ministry</i>,
every true <i>Minister</i> is to know the Spirit of God by its Virtue and
Life to accompany and assist him; but because this relates to <i>Worship</i>,
I shall speak of it more largely in the next Proposition, which
is concerning <i>Worship</i>.</p>

<p>The last Thing to be considered and inquired into is, concerning
the <i>Maintenance of a Gospel Minister</i>; but before I proceed, I judge
it fit to speak something briefly concerning the <i>Preaching of Women</i>,
and to declare what we hold in that Matter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Women’s publick Preaching and Praying asserted.</i></span>Seeing <i>Male and Female are one in Christ Jesus</i>, and that he gives his
Spirit no less to <i>one</i> than to the <i>other</i>, when God moveth by his Spirit
<i>in a Woman</i>, we judge it no Ways unlawful for her to preach in
the Assemblies of God’s People. Neither think we that of <i>Paul</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
1 Cor. xiv. 34. to reprove the <i>inconsiderate</i> and <i>talkative Women</i> among
the <i>Corinthians</i>, who troubled the Church of Christ with their <i>unprofitable
Questions</i>, or that, 1 <i>Tim.</i> ii. 11, 12. that <i>Women ought to learn in Silence,
not usurping Authority over the Man</i>, any Ways repugnant to this
Doctrine; because it is clear that <i>Women</i> have <i>prophesied</i> and <i>preached</i>
in the <i>Church</i>, else had that Saying of <i>Joel</i> been ill applied by <i>Peter</i>,
Acts ii. 17. And seeing <i>Paul</i> himself, in the same <i>Epistle</i> to the <i>Corinthians</i>,
giveth Rules how Women should behave themselves in their
publick <i>Preaching</i> and <i>Praying</i>, it would be a manifest Contradiction
if that other Place were taken in a larger Sense. And the same
<i>Paul</i> speaks of a <i>Woman</i> that laboured with him in the <i>Work of the
Gospel</i>: And it is written that <a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><i>Philip</i> had <i>four Daughters</i> that prophesied.
And <i>Lastly</i>, It hath been observed, that God hath <i>effectually</i>
in this Day <i>converted many Souls</i> by the <i>Ministry of Women</i>; and by
them also frequently comforted the Souls of his Children; which
manifest Experience puts the Thing beyond all Controversy.
<span class="sidenote">Quest. 4. <i>Ministers Maintenance.</i></span>
But
now I shall proceed to speak of the <i>Maintenance of Ministers</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ministers </i>Food<i> and their </i>Maintenance<i> stated.</i></span>We freely acknowledge, as the <i>Proposition</i> holds forth,
that there is an Obligation upon such to whom God sends, or among
whom he raiseth up a <i>Minister</i>, that, if Need be, they minister to
his Necessities. <i>Secondly</i>, That it is lawful for him to receive what is
necessary and convenient. To prove this I need not insist, for our
Adversaries will readily grant it to us; for the Thing we affirm is,
that this is all that these Scripture Testimonies relating to this
Thing do grant, <i>Gal.</i> vi. 6. 1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <i>Tim.</i> v. 16.
That which we then oppose in this Matter is, <i>First</i>, That it should
be constrained and limited. <i>Secondly</i>, That it should be superfluous,
chargeable, and sumptuous. And <i>Thirdly</i>, The manifest Abuse
thereof, of which I shall also briefly treat.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">I. <i>Against constrained </i>Maintenance.</span>As to the <i>First</i>, our Adversaries are forced to recur to the Example
of the <i>Law</i>; a Refuge they use in defending most of their Errors
and Superstitions, which are contrary to the Nature and Purity
of the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>They say, <i>God appointed the </i>Levites<i> the Tithes, therefore they belong
also to such as minister in holy Things under the </i>Gospel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, All that can be gathered from this is, that as the <i>Priests</i>
had <i>a</i> Maintenance allowed them under the <i>Law</i>, so also the <i>Ministers</i>
and <i>Preachers</i> under the <i>Gospel</i>, which is not denied; but the Comparison
will not hold that they should have the <i>very same</i>; since, <i>First</i>,
There is no express <i>Gospel Command</i> for it, neither by Christ nor his
Apostles.
<span class="sidenote">Tithes<i> were appointed for the </i>Levites<i>, not for </i>Gospel Preachers.</span><i>Secondly</i>, The Parity doth no Ways hold betwixt the <i>Levites</i>
under the <i>Law</i>, and the <i>Preachers</i> under the <i>Gospel</i>; because the
<i>Levites</i> were one of the Tribes of <i>Israel</i>, and so had a Right to a
Part of the Inheritance of the Land as well as the rest of their Brethren;
and having none, had this allotted to them in Lieu of it.
Next, The tenth of the <i>Tithes</i> was only allowed to the <i>Priests</i> that
served at the Altar, the rest being for the <i>Levites</i>, and also to be put
up in Store-houses, for entertaining of Widows and Strangers. But
these <i>Preachers</i>, notwithstanding they inherit what they have by their
Parents, as well as other Men, yet claim the whole <i>Tithes</i>, allowing
nothing either to Widow or Stranger. But as to the <i>Tithes</i> I shall
not insist, because divers others have clearly and learnedly treated
of them apart, and also divers <i>Protestants</i> do confess them not to be
<i>jure divino</i>; and the Parity as to the <i>Quota</i> doth not hold, but only in
general as to the <i>Obligation</i> of a <i>Maintenance</i>; which <i>Maintenance</i>,
though the Hearers be obliged to give, and fail of their Duty if they
do not, yet that it ought neither to be stinted, nor yet forced, I
prove;
<span class="sidenote">Reas. 1. <i>The </i>Gospel freely to be preached<i>, without so much a Year.</i></span>Because Christ, when he sent forth his Apostles, said, <i>Freely
ye have received, freely give</i>, Mat. x. 8. and yet they had Liberty to
receive Meat and Drink from such as offered them, to supply their
Need. Which shews that they were not to seek or require any
Thing by Force, or to stint, or make a Bargain beforehand, as the
<i>Preachers</i> as well among <i>Papists</i> as <i>Protestants</i> do in these Days, who
will not preach to any until they be first sure of so much a Year;
but on the contrary, these were to do their Duty, and freely to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>municate,
as the Lord should order them, what they had received,
without seeking or expecting a Reward.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nic. Arnoldus<i> his Answer to </i>Freely ye have received<i>, &amp;c.</i></span>The Answer given to this by <i>Nicolaus Arnoldus</i>, Exercit. Theolog.
Sect. 42, 43. is not to be forgotten, but indeed to be kept upon Record
for a perpetual Remembrance of him and his Brethren; for he
frankly answers after this Manner, <i>We have not freely received, and
therefore are not bound to give freely</i>. The Answer I confess is ingenuous
and good; for if those that receive freely are to give freely, it
would seem to follow by the Rule of <i>Contraries</i>, that those that receive
not freely ought not to give freely, and I shall grant it; only
they must grant me, that they preach not by and according to the
<i>Gift and Grace of God</i> received, nor can they be <i>good Stewards of the
manifold Grace of God</i>, as every true <i>Minister</i> ought to be;
<span class="sidenote">Simon Magus.</span>or else they
have gotten this <i>Gift</i> or <i>Grace</i> by Money, as <i>Simon Magus</i> would
have been compassing it, since they think themselves not bound to
give it without Money again. But to be plain, I believe he intended
not that it was from the <i>Gift</i> or <i>Grace of God</i> they were to preach,
but from their <i>acquired Arts</i> and <i>Studies</i>, which have cost them much
Labour and also some Money at the <i>University</i>; and therefore, as he
that puts his Stock into the publick Bank expects Interest again, so
these <i>Scholars</i>, having spent some Money in learning the Art of
Preaching, think they may boldly say <i>they have it not freely</i>; for it hath
cost them both Money and Pains, and therefore they expect both
Money and Ease again. And therefore, as <i>Arnoldus</i> gets Money for
teaching his young Students the <i>Art</i> and <i>Trade</i> of <i>Preaching</i>, so he
intends they should be repaid before they give it again to others.
<span class="sidenote"><i>All Things are set to Sale at </i>Rome<i>. To </i>Franequer<i> applied.</i></span>It was of old said, <i>Omnia venalia Romæ</i>, i. e. <i>All Things are set to Sale
at </i>Rome; but now the same Proverb may be applied to <i>Franequer</i>.
And therefore <i>Arnoldus’s Students</i>, when they go about to preach, may
safely seek and require hereby, telling the Hearers their Master’s
Maxim, <i>Nos gratis non accepimus, ergo neque gratis dare tenemur</i>. But
then they may answer again, That they find them and their Master
to be none of his <i>Ministers</i>, who when he sent forth his Disciples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span>
gave them this Command, <i>Freely ye have received, freely give</i>, and
therefore we will have none of your Teaching, because we perceive
you to be of the Number of those <a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><i>that look for their Gain from their

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXIX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Reas. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, The Scripture Testimonies that urge this are
in the same Nature of those that press <i>Charity</i> and <i>Liberality</i> towards
the Poor,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mere voluntary Deeds no Man can stint them.</i></span>and command <i>Hospitality</i>, &amp;c. but these are not nor can
be stinted to a certain Quantity, because they are Deeds merely
voluntary, where the Obedience to the Command lieth in the good
Will of the Giver, and not in the Matter of the Thing given, as
Christ sheweth in the Example of the <i>Widow’s Mite</i>. So that though
there be an Obligation upon <i>Christians</i> to minister of outward Things
to their Ministers, yet there can be no Definition of the Quantity but
by the Giver’s own Consent, and a little from one may more truly
fulfil the Obligation than a great deal from another. And therefore
as <i>Acts of Charity</i> and <i>Hospitality</i> can neither be limited nor
forced, so neither can this.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be objected, <i>That Ministers may and ought to exhort, persuade, yea
and earnestly press </i>Christians<i>, if they find them defective therein, to Acts of
Charity and Hospitality, and so may they do also to the giving of Maintenance</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, All this saith nothing for a <i>stinted</i> and <i>forced Maintenance</i>,
for which there cannot so much as the Shew of one solid Argument
be brought from Scripture. I confess <i>Ministers</i> may use Exhortation
in this as much as in any other Case, even as the Apostle
did to the <i>Corinthians</i>, shewing them their Duty;
<span class="sidenote">Paul’s<i> Labour was, that the </i>Gospel<i> might be without Charge.</i></span>but it were fit for
<i>Ministers</i> that so do (that their Testimony might have the more
Weight, and be the freer of all Suspicion of Covetousness and Self-interest)
that they might be able to say truly in the Sight of God
that which the same Apostle subjoins upon the same Occasion,
1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 15, 16, 17, 18. <i>But I have used none of these Things; neither
have I written these Things, that it should be so done unto me: For it were
better for me to die, than that any Man should make my Glorying void. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for Necessity is laid
upon me, yea Woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel. For if I do this
Thing willingly, I have a Reward; but if against my Will, a Dispensation of
the Gospel is committed unto me. What is my Reward then? Verily that when
I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ without Charge, that I
abuse not my Power in the Gospel.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Reas. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, As there is neither Precept nor Example for this forced
and stinted Maintenance in the Scripture, so the Apostle, in his
solemn Farewel to the <i>Pastors</i> and <i>Elders</i> of the Church of <i>Ephesus</i>,
guards them against it, <i>Acts</i> xx. 33, 34, 35. But if the Thing had
been either lawful or practised, he would rather have exhorted them
to be content with their stinted Hire, and not to covet more; whereas
he sheweth them, first, by his own Example, that they were not to
<span class="sidenote">Paul<i> coveted no Body’s </i>Silver<i> or </i>Gold.</span><i>covet or expect any Man’s Silver or Gold</i>; secondly, that they ought to
<i>work with their Hands</i> for an honest Livelihood, as he had done; and
lastly, he exhorts them so to do from the Words of Christ, <i>because it
is a more blessed Thing to give than to receive</i>; shewing that it is so far
from a Thing that a true Minister ought to aim at, or expect, that
it is rather a Burden to a true Minister, and Cross to him, to be reduced
to the Necessity of wanting it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Reas. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, If a forced and stinted Maintenance were to be
supposed, it would make the Ministers of Christ just one with those
<span class="sidenote"><i>No </i>Hireling<i> fitting the Gospel of </i>Christ.</span>Hirelings whom the Prophets cried out against. For certainly if a
Man make a Bargain to preach to People for so much a Year, so as
to refuse to preach unless he have it, and seek to force the People to
give it by Violence, it cannot be denied that such a one preacheth
for Hire, and so <i>looks for his Gain from his Quarter</i>, yea and <a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><i>prepares

special <i>Mark</i> of a false Prophet and an Hireling, and therefore can
no Ways belong to a true Minister of Christ.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Moderate </i>Protestants<i> and </i>Papists<i> exclaim against the Excess of the </i>Clergy<i>’s Revenues.</i></span>Next, that a superfluous Maintenance, that is, more than in Reason
is needful, ought not to be received by Christian Ministers, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
not need much Proof, seeing the more Moderate and Sober, both
among <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, readily confess it, who with one Voice
exclaim against the <i>excessive Revenues</i> of the <i>Clergy</i>; and that it may
not want a Proof from Scripture, what can be more plain than that
of the Apostle to <i>Timothy</i>? 1 <i>Tim.</i> vi. 7, 8, 9, 10. where he both shews
wherewith we ought to be content, and also the Hazard of such as
look after more; and indeed, since that very Obligation of giving
Maintenance to a Minister is founded upon their Need, and such as
have Opportunity to work are commended rather in not receiving
than in receiving, it can no Ways be supposed lawful for them to
receive more than is sufficient. And indeed, were they truly pious
and right, though necessitous, they would rather incline to take too
little, than be gaping after too much.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXXI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">II. <i>The Excess of the </i>Priests<i> and </i>Bishops<i> Revenues.</i></span>
Now that there is great Excess and Abuse hereof among
Christians, the vast Revenues which the Bishops and Priests have,
both <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, do declare; since I judge it may be said
without any Hyperbole, that some particular Persons have more paid
them yearly than Christ and his Apostles made use of in their whole
Life-time, who yet wanted not what was needful as to the outward
Man, and no Doubt deserved it far better than those that enjoy that
Fulness. But it is manifest these <i>Bishops </i>and<i> Priests love their fat </i>Benefices<i>,
and the Pleasure and Honour that attends them, so well, that they purpose
neither to follow Christ nor his Apostles Example or Advice in this Matter</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But it is usually objected, That <i>Christians are become so hard-hearted,
and generally so little heed Spiritual Things, that if Ministers had not a settled
and stinted Maintenance secured them by Law, they and their Families might
starve for Want of Bread</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, This Objection might have some Weight as to a Carnal
Ministry, made up of natural Men, who have no Life, Power, nor
Virtue with them, and so may insinuate some Need of such a Maintenance
for such a Ministry;
<span class="sidenote"><i>They wanted nothing whom God sent; they laboured with their Hands.</i></span>but it saith nothing as to such as are
called and sent of God, <i>who sends no Man a Wayfaring upon his own
Charges</i>; and so go forth in the Authority and Power of God, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>
turn People from <i>Darkness</i> to <i>Light</i>; for such can trust to him that
sendeth them, and do believe that he will provide for them, knowing
that he requireth nothing of any but what he giveth Power to
perform; and so when they return, if he enquire, can say <i>they wanted
nothing</i>. And such also when they stay in a Place, being immediately
furnished by God, and not needing to borrow and steal what
they preach from Books, and take up their Time that Way, fall a
working at their lawful Employments, and labour with their Hands,
as <i>Paul</i> did when he gathered the Church at <i>Corinth</i>. And indeed if
this Objection had any Weight, the Apostles and Primitive Pastors
should never have gone forth to convert the Nations, for fear of
Want. Doth not the Doctrine of Christ teach us to venture all, and
part with all, to serve God? Can they then be accounted Ministers
of Christ who are afraid to preach him lest they get not Money for it,
or will not do it until they be sure of their Payment? What serves
the Ministry for but to perfect the Saints, and so to convert them
from that Hard-heartedness?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But thou wilt say, <i>I have laboured and preached to them, and they are
hard-hearted still, and will not give me any Thing</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>Then surely thou hast either not been sent to them of God, and so
thy Ministry and Preaching hath not been among them in the Power,
Virtue, and Life of Christ, and so thou deservest nothing; or else
they have rejected thy Testimony, and so are not worthy, and from
such thou oughtest not to expect, yea nor yet receive any Thing, if
they would give thee, but thou oughtest to <i>shake off the Dust from thy
Feet</i>, and leave them.
<span class="sidenote">Mat. 10. 14. <i>If they reject the Testimony, shake the Dust from off thy Feet.</i></span>And how frivolous this Objection is, appears,
in that in the darkest and most superstitious Times the <i>Priests Revenues</i>
increased most, and they were most richly rewarded, though they
deserved least. So that he that is truly sent of God, as he needs not,
so neither will he, be afraid of Want, so long as he serves so good a
Master; neither will he ever forbear to do his Work for that Cause.
And indeed such as make this Objection shew truly that they <i>serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
not the Lord Christ</i>, but their own Belly, and that makes them so anxious
for want of Food to it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXXII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">II. <i>The many </i>Abuses<i> Priests </i>Maintenance<i> brings.</i></span>
But lastly, As to the <i>Abuses</i> of this Kind of Maintenance,
indeed he that would go through them all, though he did it
passingly, might make of it alone a huge Volume, they are so great
and numerous. For this Abuse, as others, crept in with the <i>Apostasy</i>,
there being nothing of this in the Primitive Times: Then the Ministers
claimed no <i>Tithes</i>, neither sought they a stinted or forced
Maintenance; but such as wanted had their Necessity supplied by
the Church, and others wrought with their Hands. But the Persecutions
being over, and the Emperors and Princes coming under the
Name of <i>Christians</i>, the Zeal of those great Men was quickly abused
by the <i>Covetousness</i> of the <i>Clergy</i>, who soon learned to change their
Cottages with the Palaces of Princes, and rested not until by Degrees
some of them came to be Princes themselves, nothing inferior
to them in Splendor, Luxury, and Magnificence; a Method of living
that honest <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i> the <i>Fisherman</i>, and <i>Paul</i> the <i>Tent-maker</i>
never coveted; and perhaps as little imagined that Men pretending
to be their Successors should have arrived to these Things. And so
soon as the Bishops were thus seated and constituted, forgetting the
Life and Work of a Christian, they went usually by the Ears together
about the Precedency and Revenues, each coveting the chiefest
and fattest Benefice.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestants<i> having forsaken the Pope, yet would not forsake the rich Popish Revenues.</i></span>It is also to be regretted to think how soon
this Mischief crept in among <i>Protestants</i>, who had scarce well appeared
when the <i>Clergy</i> among them began to speak at the old Rate, and
shew that though they had forsaken the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, they were
not resolved to part with their old <i>Benefices</i>; and therefore so soon
as any Princes or States shook off the <i>Pope</i>’s Authority, and so demolished
the <i>Abbies</i>, <i>Nunneries</i>, and other <i>Monuments of Superstition</i>, the
reformed <i>Clergy</i> began presently to cry out to the Magistrates to beware
of meddling with the Church’s <i>Patrimony</i>, severely exclaiming
against making a lawful Use of those vast Revenues that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
superstitiously bestowed upon the Church, so called, to the Good and
Benefit of the Commonwealth, as no less than <i>Sacrilege</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">1. <i>The </i>Clergy<i>’s Covetousness.</i></span>But by keeping up of this Kind of Maintenance for the <i>Ministry</i>
and <i>Clergymen</i>, so called, there is first a Bait laid for <i>Covetousness</i>, <i>which
is Idolatry</i>, and of all Things most hurtful; so that for <i>Covetousness</i>
Sake, many, being led by the Desire of <i>filthy Lucre</i>, do apply themselves
to be Ministers, that they may get a Livelihood by it. If a
Man have several Children, he will allot one of them to be a Minister;
which if he can get it to be, he reckons it as good as a Patrimony:
So that a fat Benefice hath always many Expectants; and
then what Bribing, what Courting, what Industry, and shameful
Actions are used to acquire these Things, is too openly known, and
needs not to be proved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The greedy </i>Kirk<i>, a Proverb.</i></span>The Scandal that by these Means is raised among Christians is so
manifest, that it is become a Proverb, that <i>the</i> Kirk <i>is always</i> greedy.
Whereby the Gift and Grace of God being neglected, they have for
the most Part no other Motive or Rule in applying themselves to one
Church more than another but the greater Benefice. For though
they hypocritically pretend, at their accepting of and entering into
their Church, that they have nothing before them but the <i>Glory of
God</i> and the <i>Salvation of Souls</i>; yet if a richer Benefice offer itself, they
presently find it more for God’s Glory to remove from the first, and
go thither. And thus they make no Difficulty often to change, while
notwithstanding they accuse us that we allow Ministers to go from
Place to Place, and not to be tied to one Place; but we allow this
not for the gaining of Money, but as moved of God. For if a Minister
be called to minister in a particular Place, he ought not to
leave it, except God call him from it, and then he ought to obey:
For we make <i>the Will of God inwardly revealed</i>, and <i>not</i> the <i>Love of Money</i>
and more <i>Gain</i>, the <i>Ground</i> of <i>removing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">2. <i>The </i>Clergy<i>’s Luxury.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, From this Abuse hath proceeded that <i>Luxury</i> and <i>Idleness</i>
that most of the <i>Clergy</i> live in, even among <i>Protestants</i> as well as
<i>Papists</i>, to the great Scandal of Christianity. For not having lawful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
Trades to work with their Hands, and being so superfluously and
sumptuously provided for, they live in <i>Idleness</i> and <i>Luxury</i>; and
there doth more <i>Pride</i>, <i>Vanity</i>, and <i>worldly Glory</i> appear in their <i>Wives</i>
and <i>Children</i> than in most others, which is open and evident to all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">3. <i>The </i>Clergy<i>’s Cruelty.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, They become hereby so <i>glued</i> to the <i>Love</i> of <i>Money</i>, that
there is none like them in <i>Malice</i>, <i>Rage</i>, and <i>Cruelty</i>. If they be denied
their Hire, they rage like drunken Men, fret, fume, and as it
were go mad. A Man may sooner satisfy the severest Creditor than
them; the general Voice of the Poor doth confirm this. For indeed
they are far more exact in taking up the Tithes of <i>Sheep</i>, <i>Geese</i>,
<i>Swine</i>, and <i>Eggs</i>, &amp;c. and look more narrowly to it than to the Members
of their Flock: They will not miss the least Mite; and the poorest
Widow cannot escape their avaricious Hands.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Poor </i>Widow’s Mite<i> cannot escape the Priest’s </i>greedy Hands.</span>Twenty Lies they
will hear unreproved; and as many Oaths a Man may swear in
their Hearing without offending them; and greater Evils than all
this they can overlook. But if thou owest them aught, and refusest
to pay it, then nothing but War will they thunder against thee,
and they will stigmatize thee with the horrible Title of <i>Sacrilege</i>,
and send thee to Hell without Mercy, as if thou hadst committed
the Sin against the Holy Ghost. Of all People we can best bear Witness
to this;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Work of </i>Antichrist<i> is Fury, Envy, Malice.</i></span>for God having shewn us this corrupt and Antichristian
Ministry, and called us out from it, and gathered us unto his own
Power and Life, to be a <i>separate People</i>, so that we dare not join
with, nor hear these Antichristian Hirelings, neither yet put into
their Mouths, or feed them. Oh! what Malice, Envy, and Fury
hath this raised in their Hearts against us! That though we get
none of their Wares, neither will buy them, as knowing them to
be naught, yet will they force us to give them Money: And because
we cannot for Conscience Sake do it, our Sufferings have upon
that Account been unutterable. Yea, to give Account of their
Cruelty, and several Sorts of Inhumanity used against us, would
make no small History. These avaricious Hirelings have come to
that Degree of Malice and Rage, that several poor labouring Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
have been carried hundreds of Miles from their own Dwellings, and
shut up in Prison, some two, some three, yea, some seven Years
together, for the Value of one Pound Sterling, and less.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Widow for the Tithe of </i>Geese<i> about four Years in Prison.</i></span>I know
myself a poor Widow, that for the Tithes of her <i>Geese</i>, which
amounted not to five Shillings, was about four Years kept in Prison,
thirty Miles from her House. Yea, they by Violence for this Cause
have plundered of Men’s Goods the Hundred-fold, and prejudiced
much more; yea, Hundreds have hereby spilt their innocent Blood;
by dying in the <i>filthy noisome Holes</i> and <i>Prisons</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Some lost their Lives in nasty Holes, some wounded by the Priests</i>, &amp;c.</span>And some of the
<i>Priests</i> have been so enraged, that Goods thus ravished could not
satisfy them; but they must also satisfy their Fury by beating,
knocking, and wounding with their Hands innocent Men and Women,
for refusing (for Conscience Sake) to put into their Mouths.</p>

<p>The only Way then soundly to reform and remove all these
Abuses, and take away the Ground and Occasion of them, is, to
take away all <i>stinted</i> and <i>forced Maintenance</i> and <i>Stipends</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whoso heap </i>Teachers<i> to themselves, let them provide their Stipend.</i></span>As whoever
call or appoint Teachers to themselves, let them accordingly
entertain them: And for such as are called and moved to the <i>Ministry</i>
by the Spirit of God, those that receive them, and taste of the
Good of their <i>Ministry</i>, will no Doubt provide Things needful for
them, and there will be no Need of a Law to force a Hire for them:
For he that sends them, will take care for them; and they also,

in all in Parts differ from them, so, on the other Hand, it is very like the
false Prophets and Teachers testified against and condemned in the Scripture</i>,
as may be thus briefly illustrated.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The true Ministers </i>Call.</span>I. The Ministry and Ministers we plead for, <i>are such as are immediately

</i>Ministry: So were the holy Apostles and Prophets, as appears by
these Places, <i>Matt.</i> x. 1. 5. <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 11. <i>Heb.</i> v. 4.</p>

<p>1. But the Ministry and Ministers our Opposers plead for, <i>are
such as have no immediate Call from Christ; to whom the Leading and Motion
of the Spirit is not reckoned necessary; but who are called, sent forth,
and ordained by wicked and ungodly Men</i>: Such were of old the false
Prophets and Teachers, as appears by these Places, <i>Jer.</i> xiv. 14, 15.

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>True Ministers </i>Guide.</span>II. The Ministers we plead for, <i>are such as are actuated and led by

from 1 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <i>Tit.</i> i. 7, 8, 9.</p>

<p>2. But the Ministers our Adversaries plead for, <i>are such to
whom the Grace of God is no needful Qualification; and so may be true Ministers,

not for, nor expect, nor need the Spirit of God to actuate and move them in the
Work of the Ministry; but what they do they do from their own mere natural

of the Scripture, and other Books, and so speak it forth in the Strength of

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>True Ministers </i>Humility.</span>IV. The Ministers we plead for, <i>are such as, being holy and humble,
contend not for Precedency and Priority, but rather strive to prefer one
another, and serve one another in Love; neither desire to be distinguished
from the rest by their Garments and large Phylacteries, nor seek the Greetings

<p class="chapter-head"><span class="sidenote"><i>What the true Worship is, that is acceptable to God.</i></span><i>All true and acceptable </i>Worship<i> to God is offered in the inward
and immediate Moving and Drawing of his own Spirit, which is
neither limited to Places, Times, nor Persons. For though we
are to worship him always, and continually to fear before him</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>How to be performed.</i></span><i>yet as to the outward Signification thereof, in </i>Prayers<i>, </i>Praises<i>,

<span class="sidenote"><i>Superstition and Will-worship, Idolatry.</i></span><i>However it might have pleased him

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span></p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> The <i>Duty of Man</i> towards God lieth chiefly in these two
Generals. 1. <i>In an holy Conformity to the pure Law and Light
of God, so as both to forsake the Evil, and be found in the Practice of those
perpetual and moral Precepts of Righteousness and Equity.</i> And 2. <i>In rendering
that Reverence, Honour and Adoration to God, that he requires and
demands of us</i>; which is comprehended under <i>Worship</i>. Of the <i>former</i>
we have already spoken, as also of the different Relations of <i>Christians</i>,
as they are distinguished by the several Measures of Grace received,
and given to every one; and in that Respect have their several
Offices in the <i>Body of Christ</i>, which is the <i>Church</i>. Now I come to
speak of <i>Worship</i>, or of those Acts, whether private or publick, general
or particular, whereby Man renders to God that Part of his Duty
which relates immediately to him: And as <i>Obedience is better than Sacrifice</i>,
so neither is any Sacrifice <i>acceptable</i>, but that which is done
according to the Will of him to whom it is <i>offered</i>. But Men, finding
it easier to <i>sacrifice</i> in their own Wills, than obey God’s Will,
have heaped up <i>Sacrifices</i> without <i>Obedience</i>;
<span class="sidenote">True<i> Worship and Duty to God-wards corrupted.</i></span>and thinking to deceive
God, as they do one another, give him a Shew of Reverence, Honour
and Worship, while they are both inwardly estranged and alienated
from his holy and righteous Life, and wholly Strangers to the pure
Breathings of his Spirit, in which the acceptable Sacrifice and Worship
is only offered up. Hence it is, that there is not any Thing
relating to Man’s Duty towards God, which among all Sorts of People
hath been more vitiated, and in which the Devil hath more prevailed,
than in abusing Man’s Mind concerning this Thing: And
as among many others, so among those called <i>Christians</i>, nothing hath
been more out of Order, and more corrupted, as some <i>Papists</i> and
all <i>Protestants</i>, do acknowledge. As I freely approve whatsoever the
<i>Protestants</i> have reformed from <i>Papists</i> in this Respect; so I meddle not
at this Time with their Controversies about it:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Popish Mass (Idolatry)<i> denied, with all their </i>Trumpery.</span>Only it suffices me
with them to deny, as no Part of the true Worship of God, that
abominable Superstition and Idolatry the <i>Popish Mass</i>, the <i>Adoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
of Saints and Angels</i>, the <i>Veneration of Relicks</i>, the <i>Visitation of Sepulchres</i>,
and all those other superstitious Ceremonies, <i>Confraternities</i>, and
<i>endless Pilgrimages</i> of the <i>Romish Synagogue</i>. Which all may suffice to
evince to <i>Protestants</i>, that <i>Antichrist</i> hath wrought more in this than in
any other Part of the <i>Christian Religion</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>If </i>Protestants<i> have made a </i>perfect Reformation.</span>and so it concerns them narrowly
to consider, whether herein they have made a clear and perfect
Reformation; as to which stands the Controversy betwixt them
and us. For we find many of the Branches lopt off by them, but
the Root yet remaining; to wit, a <i>Worship</i> acted in and from Man’s
Will and Spirit, and not by and from the Spirit of God: For the
true <i>Christian</i> and <i>Spiritual Worship of God</i> hath been so early lost, and
Man’s Wisdom and Will hath so quickly and throughly mixed itself
herein, that both the <i>Apostasy</i> in this Respect hath been greatest, and
the <i>Reformation</i> herefrom, as to the evil Root, most difficult. Therefore
let not the <i>Reader</i> suddenly stumble at the Account of our <i>Proposition</i>
in this Matter, but patiently hear us explain ourselves in this
Respect, and I hope (by the Assistance of God) to make it appear,
that though our Manner of Speaking and Doctrine seem most singular
and different from all other Sorts of <i>Christians</i>; yet it is most according
to the purest <i>Christian Religion</i>, and indeed most needful to be observed
and followed. And that there be no Ground of Mistake (for
that I was necessitated to speak in few Words, and therefore more
obscurely and dubiously in the <i>Proposition</i> itself) it is fit in the first
Place to declare and explain our Sense, and clear the <i>State of the
Controversy</i>.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I. <i>What </i>Worship<i> here is spoken of.</i></span>
And first, let it be considered, that what is here affirmed, is
spoken of the <i>Worship of God</i> in these <i>Gospel-times</i>, and not of the Worship
that was under or before the <i>Law</i>: For the particular Commands of
God to Men <i>then</i>, are not sufficient to authorize us <i>now</i> to do the same
Things; else we might be supposed at present acceptably to offer Sacrifice
as they did, which all acknowledge to be ceased. So that what
might have been both commendable and acceptable under the <i>Law</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span>
may justly now be charged with Superstition, yea, and Idolatry. So
that impertinently, in this Respect, doth <i>Arnoldus</i> rage against this
Proposition, [<i>Exercit. Theolog.</i> Sect. 44.] saying; <i>That I deny all publick
Worship, and that according to me, such as in </i>Enoch<i>’s Time publickly began to
call upon the Name of the Lord; and such as at the Command of God went thrice
up to </i>Jerusalem<i> to worship; and that </i>Anna<i>, </i>Simeon<i>, </i>Mary<i>, &amp;c. were
Idolaters, because they used the publick Worship of those Times</i>; such a Consequence
is most impertinent; and no less foolish and absurd, than
if I should infer from <i>Paul</i>’s expostulating with the <i>Galatians</i> for their
returning to the <i>Jewish Ceremonies</i>, that he therefore condemned <i>Moses</i>
and all the <i>Prophets</i> as foolish and ignorant, because they used those
Things: The forward Man, not heeding the different Dispensation
of Times, ran into this Impertinency.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Ceremonies under the Law were not essential to true</i> Worship.</span>Though a spiritual Worship
might have been, and no Doubt was practised by many under the
<i>Law</i> in great Simplicity; yet will it not follow, that it were no Superstition
to use all those <i>Ceremonies</i> that they used, which were by
God dispensed to the <i>Jews</i>, not as being essential to <i>true Worship</i>, or
necessary as of themselves for transmitting and entertaining an <i>holy
Fellowship</i> betwixt him and his People; but in Condescension to them,
who were inclinable to Idolatry. Albeit then in this, as in most
other Things, the Substance was enjoyed under the <i>Law</i> by such as
were spiritual indeed; yet was it veiled and surrounded with many
<i>Rites</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i>, which it is no Ways lawful for us to use now
under the <i>Gospel</i>.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">II. True Worship <i>is not limited to Place or Person.</i></span>
<i>Secondly</i>, Albeit I say, that this <i>Worship</i> is neither limited
to Times, Places nor Persons; yet I would not be understood, as if
I intended the putting away of all set Times and Places to worship:
God forbid I should think of such an Opinion. Nay, we are none
of those that <i>forsake the Assembling of ourselves</i> together; but have even
certain Times and Places, in which we carefully meet together (nor
can we be driven therefrom by the Threats and Persecutions of Men)
to <i>wait upon God</i>, and <i>worship him</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Necessity of Meetings.</i></span>To <i>meet together</i> we think necessary
for the People of God; because, so long as we are clothed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
this outward Tabernacle, there is a Necessity to the entertaining of
a joint and visible Fellowship, and bearing of an outward Testimony
for God, and seeing of the Faces of one another, that we
concur with our Persons as well as Spirits: To be accompanied
with that inward Love and Unity of Spirit, doth greatly tend to encourage
and refresh the Saints.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">1. Will-worship<i> doth limit the Spirit of God.</i></span>But the <i>Limitation</i> we condemn is, that whereas the Spirit of God
should be the immediate Actor, Mover, Persuader and Influencer
of Man in the particular Acts of Worship, when the Saints are met
together, this Spirit is <i>limited</i> in its Operations, by setting up a particular
Man or Men to preach and pray in Man’s Will; and all the
rest are excluded from so much as believing that they are to wait
for God’s Spirit to move them in such Things: And so they neglecting
that in themselves which should quicken them, and not
waiting to feel the pure Breathings of God’s Spirit, so as to obey
them, are led merely to depend upon the Preacher, and hear what
he will say.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">2. <i>True </i>Teaching<i> of the Word of God.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, In that these peculiar Men come not thither to meet
with the Lord, and to wait for the inward Motions and Operations
of his Spirit; and so to pray as they feel the Spirit to breathe
<i>through</i> them, and <i>in</i> them; and to preach, as they find themselves
actuated and moved by God’s Spirit, and as he gives Utterance, so
as to speak a Word in Season to refresh weary Souls, and as the
present Condition and State of the People’s Hearts require; suffering
God by his Spirit both to prepare People’s Hearts, and also give
the Preacher to speak what may be fit and seasonable for them: But
he (viz. <i>the Preacher</i>) hath hammered together in his Closet, according
to his own Will, by his human Wisdom and Literature,
and by stealing the Words of Truth from the Letter of the Scriptures,
and patching together other Men’s Writings and Observations,
so much as will hold him speaking an Hour, while the Glass
runs;
<span class="sidenote">Priests<i> preach by Hap-hazard their studied Sermons.</i></span>and without waiting or feeling the inward Influence of the
Spirit of God, he declaims that by Hap-hazard, whether it be fit or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span>
seasonable for the People’s Condition, or not; and when he has
ended his Sermon, he saith his Prayer also in his own Will; and
so <i>there is an End of the Business</i>. Which <i>customary Worship</i>, as it is no
Ways acceptable to God, so how unfruitful it is, and unprofitable
to those that are found in it, the present Condition of the Nations
doth sufficiently declare. It appears then, that we are not against
<i>set Times</i> for Worship, as <i>Arnoldus</i> against this Proposition, <i>Sect. 45</i>.
no less impertinently allegeth; offering needlesly to prove that which
is not denied: Only these Times being appointed for outward Conveniency,
we may not therefore think with the <i>Papists</i>, that these
Days are <i>holy</i>, and lead People into a superstitious Observation of
them; being persuaded that <i>all Days are alike holy in the Sight of God</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether Days are holy.</i></span>And although it be not my present Purpose to make a long Digression
concerning the Debates among <i>Protestants</i> about the <i>first Day of
the Week</i>, commonly called the <i>Lord’s Day</i>, yet forasmuch as it comes
fitly in here, I shall briefly signify our Sense thereof.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of the </i>First Day<i> of the </i>Week<i>, commonly called the </i>Lord’s Day.</span>We, not seeing any Ground in Scripture for it, cannot be
so superstitious as to believe, that either the <i>Jewish Sabbath</i> now continues,
or that the <i>first Day</i> of the <i>Week</i> is the <i>Anti-type</i> thereof, or
the true <i>Christian Sabbath</i>; which with <i>Calvin</i> we believe to have a
more <i>spiritual Sense</i>: And therefore we know no moral Obligation by
the <i>fourth Command</i>, or elsewhere, to keep the <i>first Day of the Week</i>
more than any other, or any Holiness inherent in it. But <i>First</i>,
forasmuch as it is necessary that there be some Time set apart for
the Saints to meet together to wait upon God; and that <i>Secondly</i>,
it is fit at some Times they be freed from their other outward Affairs;
and that <i>Thirdly</i>, Reason and Equity doth allow that Servants
and Beasts have some Time allowed them to be eased from their
continual Labour; and that <i>Fourthly</i>, it appears that the Apostles
and Primitive Christians did use the <i>first Day of the Week</i> for these
Purposes; we find ourselves sufficiently moved for these Causes to
do so also, without superstitiously straining the Scriptures for another
Reason: Which, that it is not to be there found, many <i>Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>testants</i>,
yea, <i>Calvin</i> himself, upon the <i>fourth Command</i>, hath abundantly
evinced. And though we therefore meet, and abstain from
working upon this <i>Day</i>, yet doth not that hinder us from having
<i>Meetings</i> also for <i>Worship</i> at other Times.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3> <i>Thirdly</i>, Though according to the Knowledge of God, revealed
unto us by the Spirit, through that more <i>full Dispensation of
Light</i> which we believe the Lord hath brought about in this Day,
we judge it our Duty to hold forth that pure and spiritual Worship
which is acceptable to God, and answerable to the Testimony of
Christ and his Apostles, and likewise to testify against and deny not
only manifest Superstition and Idolatry, but also all formal Will-worship,
which stands not in the Power of God;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Worship<i> in the Apostasy.</i></span>yet, I say, we do
not deny the whole Worship of all those that have borne the Name
of <i>Christians</i> even in the Apostasy, as if God had never heard their
Prayers, nor accepted any of them: God forbid we should be so
void of Charity! The latter Part of the Proposition sheweth the
Contrary. And as we would not be so <i>absurd</i> on the one Hand to
conclude, because of the Errors and Darkness that many were covered
and surrounded with in <i>Babylon</i>, that none of their Prayers
were heard or accepted of God, so will we not be so <i>unwary</i> on the
other, as to conclude, that because God heard and pitied them, so
we ought to continue in these Errors and Darkness, and not come
out of <i>Babylon</i>, when it is by God discovered unto us.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Popish Mass or Vespers.</i></span>The <i>Popish
Mass</i> and <i>Vespers</i> I do believe to be, as to the Matter of them, <i>abominable
Idolatry</i> and <i>Superstition</i>, and so also believe the <i>Protestants</i>;
yet will neither <i>I</i> or <i>they</i> affirm, that in the Darkness of <i>Popery</i> no
Upright-hearted Men, though zealous in these Abominations, have
been heard of God, or accepted of him:
<span class="sidenote">Bernard<i> and </i>Bonaventure, Taulerus, Tho. à Kempis,<i> have tasted of the Love of God.</i></span>Who can deny, but that
both <i>Bernard</i> and <i>Bonaventure, Taulerus, Thomas à Kempis,</i> and divers
others have both known and tasted of the Love of God, and felt
the Power and Virtue of God’s Spirit working with them for their
Salvation? And yet ought we not to forsake and deny those Superstitions
which they were found in? The <i>Calvinistical Presbyterians</i> do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
much upbraid (and I say not without Reason) the Formality and
Deadness of the <i>Episcopalian</i> and <i>Lutheran Liturgies</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Bishops Liturgy.</i></span>and yet, as they
will not deny but there have been some good Men among them, so
neither dare they refuse, but that when that good Step was brought
in by them, of turning the publick Prayers into the vulgar Tongues,
though continued in a <i>Liturgy</i>, it was acceptable to God, and
sometimes accompanied with his Power and Presence: Yet will not
the <i>Presbyterians</i> have it from thence concluded, that the <i>Common
Prayers</i> should still continue; so likewise, though we should confess,
that, through the Mercy and wonderful Condescension of God,
there have been upright in Heart, both among <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>,
yet can we not therefore approve of their Way in the General, or
not go on to the upholding of that <i>spiritual Worship</i>, which the Lord
is calling all to, and so to the testifying against whatsoever stands in
the Way of it.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assemblies of Worship in Publick described.</i></span><i>Fourthly</i>, To come then to the <i>State of the Controversy</i>, as to
the <i>publick Worship</i>, we judge it the Duty of all to be diligent in the
Assembling of themselves together (and what we have been, and
are, in this Matter, our Enemies in <i>Great Britain</i>, who have used
all Means to hinder our assembling together to worship God, may
bear Witness) and when assembled, the great Work of one and all
ought to be to wait upon God; and returning out of their own
Thoughts and Imaginations, to feel the Lord’s Presence, and know
a <i>Gathering into his Name</i> indeed, where he is <i>in the Midst</i>, according
to his Promise. And as every one is thus gathered, and so met together
inwardly in their Spirits, as well as outwardly in their Persons,
there the secret Power and Virtue of Life is known to refresh
the Soul, and the pure Motions and Breathings of God’s Spirit
are felt to arise; from which, as Words of Declaration, Prayers
or Praises arise, the acceptable Worship is known, which edifies
the Church, and is well-pleasing to God. And no Man here limits
the Spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered
Stuff; but every one puts that forth which the Lord puts into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
Hearts: And it is uttered forth not in Man’s Will and Wisdom,
but <i>in the Evidence and Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Its glorious </i>Dispensation.</span>Yea,
though there be not a Word spoken, yet is the true spiritual
Worship performed, and the Body of Christ edified; yea, it may,
and hath often fallen out among us, that divers Meetings have past
without one Word; and yet our Souls have been greatly edified and
refreshed, and our Hearts wonderfully overcome with the secret
Sense of God’s Power and Spirit, which without Words hath been
ministered from one Vessel to another. This is indeed strange and
incredible to the mere natural and carnally-minded Man, who will
be apt to judge all Time lost where there is not something spoken
that is obvious to the outward Senses; and therefore I shall insist a
little upon this Subject, as one that can speak from a certain Experience,
and not by mere Hearsay, of this wonderful and glorious
Dispensation; which hath so much the more of the Wisdom and
Glory of God in it, as it is contrary to the Nature of Man’s Spirit,
Will, and Wisdom.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The silent waiting upon God obtained.</i></span>As there can be nothing more opposite to the natural
Will and Wisdom of Man than this <i>silent Waiting upon God</i>, so neither
can it be obtained, nor rightly comprehended by Man, but as
he layeth down his own Wisdom and Will, so as to be content to
be throughly subject to God. And therefore it was not preached,
nor can be so practised, but by such as find no outward Ceremony,
no Observations, no Words, yea, not the best and purest Words,
even the Words of Scripture, able to satisfy their weary and afflicted
Souls: Because where all these may be, the Life, Power, and
Virtue, which make such Things effectual, may be wanting. Such,
I say, were necessitated to cease from all Externals, and to be silent
before the Lord; and <a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>being directed to that inward Principle of <i>Life</i>
and <i>Light</i> in themselves, as the most excellent Teacher, which <i>can
never be removed into a Corner</i>, came thereby to be taught to wait
upon God in the Measure of <i>Life</i> and <i>Grace</i> received from him, and
to cease from their own forward Words and Actings, in the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span>
Willing and Comprehension, and feel after this inward Seed of Life;
that, as it moveth, they may move with it, and be actuated by its
Power, and influenced, whether to pray, preach or sing. And so
from this Principle of Man’s being silent, and not acting in the
Things of God of himself, until thus actuated by God’s <i>Light</i> and
<i>Grace in the Heart</i>, did naturally spring that Manner of sitting
silent together, and waiting together upon the Lord. For many
thus principled, meeting together in the pure Fear of the Lord, did
not apply themselves presently to speak, pray, or sing, <i>&amp;c.</i> being
afraid to be found acting forwardly in their own Wills, but each
made it their Work to retire inwardly to the Measure of Grace
in themselves, not being only silent as to Words, but even abstaining
from all their own Thoughts, Imaginations and Desires; so
watching in a holy <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Dependance">Dependence</span> upon the Lord, and meeting together not only outwardly in one Place,
<span class="sidenote"><i>What it is to meet in </i>Jesus<i> Name.</i></span>but thus inwardly in <i>one Spirit</i>, and in <i>one Name of Jesus</i>, which is his Power and Virtue, they
come thereby to enjoy and feel the Arisings of this Life, which, as
it prevails in each Particular, becomes as a Flood of Refreshment, and
overspreads the whole Meeting: For Man, and Man’s Part and
Wisdom, being denied and chained down in every Individual, and
God exalted, and his Grace in Dominion in the Heart, thus his
<i>Name</i> comes to be <i>one</i> in <i>all</i>, and his Glory breaks forth, and covers
all; and there is such a holy Awe and Reverence upon every Soul,
that if the natural Part should arise in any, or the wise Part, or what
is not one with the Life, it would presently be chained down, and
judged out. And when any are, through the Breaking forth of this
Power, constrained to utter a Sentence of Exhortation or Praise, or
to breathe to the Lord in Prayer, then all are sensible of it; for the
same Life in them answers to it, <a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><i>as in Water Face answereth to Face</i>.
This is that <i>divine</i> and <i>spiritual Worship</i>, which the World neither
knoweth nor understandeth, which the <i>Vulture</i>’s Eye seeth not into.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Advantages of </i>silent Meetings.</span>Yet many and great are the Advantages which my Soul, with many
others, hath tasted of hereby, and which would be found of all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span>
as would seriously apply themselves hereunto: For, when People
are gathered thus together, not merely to hear Men, nor depend
upon them, but <a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a><i>all are inwardly taught to stay their Minds upon the
Lord, and wait for his Appearance in their Hearts</i>; thereby the forward
Working of the Spirit of Man is stayed and hindered from mixing
itself with the Worship of God; and the Form of this Worship is so
naked and void of all outward and worldly Splendor, that all Occasion
for Man’s Wisdom to be exercised in that Superstition and
Idolatry hath no Lodging here; and so there being also an inward
Quietness and Retiredness of Mind, the <i>Witness of God</i> ariseth <i>in the
Heart</i>, and the <i>Light of Christ</i> shineth, whereby the Soul cometh to
see its own Condition. And there being many joined together in
the same Work, there is an inward Travail and Wrestling; and also,
as the Measure of Grace is abode in, an Overcoming of the Power
and Spirit of Darkness; and thus we are often greatly strengthened
and renewed in the Spirits of our Minds without a Word, and we
enjoy and possess the <a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a><i>holy Fellowship</i> and <i>Communion of the Body and
Blood of Christ</i>, by which our inward Man is nourished and fed;
which makes us not to dote upon outward <i>Water</i>, and <i>Bread</i> and
<i>Wine</i>, in our spiritual Things. Now as many thus gathered together
grow up in the Strength, Power, and Virtue of Truth, and
as Truth comes thus to have Victory and Dominion in their Souls,
then they receive an Utterance, and speak steadily to the Edification
of their Brethren, and the <i>pure Life</i> hath a free Passage through
them, and what is thus spoken edifieth the Body indeed.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Speaking to Edification.</i></span>Such is the evident Certainty of that divine Strength that is communicated
by thus meeting together, and waiting in Silence upon God, that
sometimes when one hath come in that hath been unwatchful and
wandering in his Mind, or suddenly out of the Hurry of outward
Business, and so not inwardly gathered with the rest, so soon as he
retires himself inwardly, this Power being in a good Measure raised
in the whole Meeting, will suddenly lay Hold upon his Spirit, and
wonderfully help to raise up the Good in him, and beget him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
the Sense of the same Power, to the Melting and Warming of his
Heart; even as the Warmth would take Hold upon a Man that is
cold coming into a Stove, or as a Flame will lay Hold upon some
little combustible Matter being near unto it. Yea, if it fall out that
several met together be straying in their Minds, though outwardly
silent, and so wandering from the Measure of Grace in themselves
(which through the Working of the Enemy, and Negligence of
some, may fall out) if either one come in, or may be in, who is
watchful, and in whom the <i>Life</i> is raised in a great Measure, as that
one keeps his Place, he will feel a secret Travail for the rest in a
Sympathy with the <i>Seed</i> which is oppressed in the other, and kept
from arising by their Thoughts and Wanderings;
<span class="sidenote"><i>A secret Travail one for another in silent Meetings</i>.</span>and as such a faithful one waits in the <i>Light</i>, and keeps in this <i>divine Work</i>, God
oftentimes answers the secret Travail and Breathings of his own
<i>Seed</i> through such a one, so that the rest will find themselves <i>secretly
smitten</i> without Words, and that one will be as a <i>Midwife</i> through
the secret Travails of his Soul to bring forth the Life in them, just
as a little Water thrown into a Pump brings up the rest, whereby
Life will come to be raised in all, and the vain Imaginations
brought down; and such a one is felt by the rest to minister Life
unto them without Words. Yea, sometimes when there is not a
Word in the Meeting, but all are silently waiting, if one come in
that is rude and wicked, and in whom the Power of Darkness prevaileth
much, perhaps with an Intention to mock or do Mischief, if
the whole Meeting be gathered into the <i>Life</i>, and it be raised in a
good Measure, it will strike Terror into such an one,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Mocker struck with</i> Terror <i>when no Word is spoken</i>.</span>and he will feel himself unable to resist; but by the secret Strength and Virtue
thereof, the Power of Darkness in him will be chained down: And
if the Day of his Visitation be not expired, it will reach to the
Measure of Grace in him, and raise it up to the Redeeming of his
Soul. And this we often bear Witness of, so that we have had
frequent Occasion in this Respect, since God hath gathered us to be
a People, to renew this old Saying of many, <a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a><i>Is </i>Saul<i> also among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
Prophets?</i> For not a few have come to be convinced of the Truth
after this Manner, of which I myself, in Part, am a true Witness,
who not by Strength of Arguments, or by a particular Disquisition
of each Doctrine, and Convincement of my Understanding thereby,
came to receive and bear Witness of the Truth, but by being secretly reached by this <i>Life</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The true Convincement.</i></span>for when I came into the <i>silent Assemblies</i>
of God’s People, I felt a <i>secret Power</i> among them, which touched
my Heart, and as I gave Way unto it, I found the Evil weakening
in me, and the Good raised up, and so I became thus knit and
united unto them, hungering more and more after the Increase of
this Power and Life, whereby I might feel myself perfectly redeemed.
And indeed this is the surest Way to become a <i>Christian</i>, to
whom afterwards the Knowledge and Understanding of <i>Principles</i>
will not be wanting, but will grow up so much as is needful, as the
natural Fruit of this good Root, and such a Knowledge will not be
<i>barren</i> nor <i>unfruitful</i>. After this Manner we desire therefore all that
come among us to be proselyted, knowing that though Thousands
should be convinced in their Understanding of all the <i>Truths</i> we
maintain, yet if they were not sensible of this <i>inward Life</i>, and their
Souls not changed from Unrighteousness to Righteousness, they could add nothing to us.
<span class="sidenote">1 Cor. 6. 17. <i>The Life of Righteousness doth join us to the Lord.</i></span>For this is that <i>Cement</i> whereby we are joined <i>as to the Lord</i>, so to one another, and without this none can
worship with us. Yea, if such should come among us, and from
that Understanding and Convincement they have of the <i>Truth</i>, speak
ever so true Things, and utter them forth with ever so much Excellency
of Speech, if this <i>Life</i> were wanting, it would not edify us at
all, but be as <i>sounding Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal</i>, 1 Cor. xiii. 1.</div>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Our Work and Worship in our Meetings.</i></span>Our <i>Work</i> then and <i>Worship</i> is, when we meet together,
for every one to <i>watch and wait upon God in themselves</i>, and to be <i>gathered</i>
from all Visibles thereunto. And as every one is thus stated,
they come to find the <i>Good</i> arise over the <i>Evil</i>, and the <i>Pure</i> over
the <i>Impure</i>, in which God reveals himself, and draweth near to every
Individual, and so he is in the Midst in the General, whereby each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
not only partakes of the particular Refreshment and Strength which
comes from the Good in himself, but is a Sharer in the whole Body,
as being a living Member of the Body, having a joint Fellowship
and Communion with all. And as this Worship is stedfastly
preached and kept to, it becomes easy, though it be very hard at
first to the natural Man, whose roving Imaginations and running
worldly Desires are not so easily brought to Silence. And therefore
the Lord Often-times, when any turn towards him, and have true
Desires thus to Wait upon him, and find great Difficulty through the
Unstayedness of their Minds, doth in Condescension and Compassion
cause his Power to break forth in a more strong and powerful
Manner. And when the Mind sinks down, and waits for the Appearance
of <i>Life</i>, and that the Power of Darkness in the Soul
wrestles and works against it, then the good Seed, as it ariseth, will
be found to work as Physick in the Soul, especially if such a weak
one be in the Assembly of divers others in whom the Life is arisen
in greater Dominion, and through the contrary Workings of the
Power of Darkness there will be found an inward Striving in the
Soul as really in the Mystery as ever <i>Esau</i> and <i>Jacob</i> strove in <i>Rebecca</i>’s
Womb.
<span class="sidenote">Esau <i>and</i> Jacob <i>strove in </i>Rebecca<i>’s Womb.</i></span>And from this inward Travail, while the <i>Darkness</i>
seeks to obscure the <i>Light</i>, and the <i>Light</i> breaks through the <i>Darkness</i>,
which it always will do, if the Soul gives not its Strength to the
Darkness, there will be such a painful Travail found in the Soul,
that will even work upon the outward Man, so that Often-times,
through the Working thereof, the Body will be greatly shaken, and
many Groans, and Sighs, and Tears, even as the Pangs of a Woman
in Travail, will lay hold upon it; yea, and this not only as
to one, but when the Enemy, who when the <i>Children of God</i> assemble
together is not wanting to be present, to see if he can let
their Comfort, hath prevailed in any Measure in a whole Meeting,
and strongly worketh against it by spreading and propagating his
dark Power, and by drawing out the Minds of such as are met from
the Life in them, as they come to be sensible of this Power of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
that works against them, and to wrestle with it by the <i>Armour of
Light</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Travail crowned with a victorious Song.</i></span>sometimes the Power of God will break forth into a whole
Meeting, and there will be such an inward Travail, while each is
seeking to overcome the Evil in themselves, that by the strong contrary
Workings of these opposite Powers, like the Going of two contrary
Tides, every Individual will be strongly exercised as in a Day
of Battle, and thereby Trembling and a Motion of Body will be
upon most, if not upon all, which, as the Power of Truth prevails,
will from Pangs and Groans end with a <i>sweet Sound of Thanksgiving</i>
and <i>Praise</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Name of </i>Quakers<i> whence it sprung.</i></span>And from this the Name of <i>Quakers</i>, i. e. <i>Tremblers</i>,
was first reproachfully cast upon us; which though it be none of
our Choosing, yet in this Respect we are not ashamed of it, but
have rather Reason to rejoice therefore, even that we are sensible of
this Power that hath oftentimes laid hold of our Adversaries, and
made them yield unto us, and join with us, and confess to the
Truth, before they had any distinct or discursive Knowledge of our
<i>Doctrines</i>, so that sometimes many at one Meeting have been thus
convinced: And this Power would sometimes also reach to and
wonderfully work even in little Children, to the Admiration and
Astonishment of many.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3> Many are the blessed Experiences which I could relate of
this <i>Silence</i> and Manner of <i>Worship</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Yet Silence is no Law, but Words may follow.</i></span>yet I do not so much commend
and speak of <i>Silence</i> as if we had bound ourselves by any Law to exclude
<i>Praying</i> or <i>Preaching</i>, or tied ourselves thereunto; not at all:
For as our <i>Worship</i> consisteth not in <i>Words</i>, so neither in <i>Silence</i>, as
<i>Silence</i>; but <i>in an holy Dependence of the Mind upon God</i>: From which
Dependence <i>Silence</i> necessarily follows in the first Place, until <i>Words</i>
can be brought forth, which are from God’s Spirit. And God is
not wanting to move in his <i>Children</i> to bring forth Words of Exhortation
or Prayer, when it is needful; so that of the many Gatherings
and Meetings of such as are convinced of the Truth, there
is scarce any in whom God raiseth not up some or other to minister
to his Brethren; and there are few Meetings that are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: alogether">altogether</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
<i>silent</i>. For when many are met together in this one Life and Name,
it doth most naturally and frequently excite them to <i>pray</i> to and
<i>praise God</i>, and stir up one another by mutual Exhortation and Instructions;
yet we judge it needful there be in the first Place some
Time of <i>Silence</i>, during which every one may be gathered <i>inwardly</i>
to the Word and Gift of Grace, from which he that ministereth may
receive Strength to bring forth what he ministereth; and that they
that hear may have a Sense to discern betwixt the <i>Precious</i> and the
<i>Vile</i>, and not to hurry into the Exercise of these Things so soon as
the Bell rings, as other <i>Christians</i> do. Yea, and we doubt not, but
assuredly know, that the Meeting may be good and refreshful,
though from the sitting down to the rising up thereof there hath not
been a Word as outwardly spoken, and yet <i>Life</i> may have been
known to abound in each Particular, and an inward growing up
therein and thereby, yea, so as Words might have been spoken acceptably,
and from the Life:
<span class="sidenote"><i>No absolute Necessity for Words, though from the Life at Times.</i></span>Yet there being no absolute Necessity
laid upon any so to do, all might have chosen rather <i>quietly</i> and
<i>silently</i> to possess and enjoy the Lord in themselves, which is very
sweet and comfortable to the Soul that hath thus learned to be gathered
out of all its own Thoughts and Workings, to feel the Lord
to bring forth both the Will and the Deed, which many can declare
by a blessed Experience: Though indeed it cannot but be hard for the
natural Man to receive or believe this <i>Doctrine</i>, and therefore it must
be rather by a sensible Experience, and by coming to make Proof
of it, than by Arguments, that such can be convinced of this Thing,
seeing it is not enough to <i>believe</i> it, if they come not also to <i>enjoy</i>
and <i>possess</i> it; yet in Condescension to, and for the Sake of, such as
may be the more willing to apply themselves to the Practice and Experience
hereof, if they found their Understandings convinced of it,
and that it is founded upon Scripture and Reason, I find a Freedom
of Mind to add some few Considerations of this Kind, for the
Confirmation hereof, besides what is before mentioned of our Experience.</div>

<span class="sidenote"><i>To </i>wait<i> and </i>watch<i> commanded in the Scripture.</i></span>That <i>to wait upon God</i>, and to <i>watch before him</i>, is a Duty
incumbent upon all, I suppose none will deny; and that this also
is <i>a Part of Worship</i> will not be called in Question, since there is
scarce any other so frequently commanded in the holy Scriptures,
as may appear from <i>Psalm</i> xxvii. 14. and xxxvii. 7. 34. <i>Prov.</i> xx. 22.
<i>Isa.</i> xxx. 18. <i>Hosea</i> xii. 6. <i>Zech.</i> iii. 8. <i>Matt.</i> xxiv. 42. and xxv. 13.
and xxvi. 41. <i>Mark</i> xiii. 33. 35. 37. <i>Luke</i> xxi. 36. <i>Acts</i> i. 4. and
xx. 31. 1 <i>Cor.</i> xvi. 13. <i>Col.</i> iv. 2. 1 <i>Thess.</i> v. 6. 2 <i>Tim.</i> iv. 5. 1 <i>Pet.</i>
iv. 7. Also this Duty is often recommended with very great and
precious Promises, as <i>Psalm</i> xxv. 3. and xxxvii. 9. and lxix. 6. <i>Isa.</i>
xlii. 23. <i>Lam.</i> iii. 25, 26. <i>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
Strength</i>, &amp;c. <i>Isa.</i> xl. 31. Now how is this <i>waiting upon God</i>, or
<i>watching before him</i>, but by this <i>Silence</i> of which we have spoken?
Which as it is in itself a <i>great</i> and <i>principal Duty</i>, so it necessarily in
order both of <i>Nature</i> and <i>Time</i> precedeth all other. But that it may
be the better and more perfectly understood, as it is not only an
<i>outward Silence</i> of the Body, but an <i>inward Silence</i> of the Mind from
all its own Imaginations and Self-cogitations, let it be considered
according to <i>Truth</i>, and to the <i>Principles</i> and <i>Doctrines</i> heretofore affirmed
and proved, that Man is to be considered in a twofold Respect,
to wit, in his <i>natural, unregenerate, and fallen State</i>, and in his
<i>spiritual and renewed Condition</i>; from whence ariseth that Distinction
of the <i>natural</i> and <i>spiritual Man</i> so much used by the Apostle, and
heretofore spoken of. Also these <i>two Births</i> of the Mind proceed
from the <i>two Seeds</i> in Man respectively, to wit, the <i>good Seed</i> and the
<i>evil</i>; and from the <i>evil Seed</i> doth not only proceed all Manner of
gross and abominable Wickedness and Profanity, but also Hypocrisy,
and those <i>Wickednesses</i> which the Scripture calls <i>spiritual</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Whence Wickednesses<i> arise that are spiritual.</i></span>because
it is the <i>Serpent</i> working in and by the natural Man in Things that
are <i>spiritual</i>, which having a Shew and Appearance of Good, are so
much the more hurtful and dangerous, as it is <i>Satan transformed</i> and
<i>transforming himself into an Angel of Light</i>; and therefore doth the
Scripture so pressingly and frequently, as we have heretofore had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
<i>Occasion</i> to observe, shut out and exclude the natural Man from
meddling with the <i>Things of God</i>, denying his Endeavours therein,
though acted and performed by the most eminent of his Parts, as of
Wisdom and Utterance.</div>

<p>Also this <i>spiritual Wickedness</i> is of two Sorts, though both one in
Kind, as proceeding from one Root, yet differing in their Degrees,
and in the Subjects also sometimes. The one is, when as the natural
Man, meddling with and working in the Things of <i>Religion</i>,
doth from his own Conceptions and Divinations affirm or propose
wrong and erroneous Notions and Opinions of God and Things spiritual,
and invent Superstitions, Ceremonies, Observations, and
Rites in Worship, from whence have sprung all the Heresies and
Superstitions that are among <i>Christians</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>From whence all Heresies did spring.</i></span>The other is, when as the
natural Man, from a mere Conviction of his Understanding, doth
in the Forwardness of his own Will, and by his own natural Strength,
without the Influence and Leading of God’s Spirit, go about either
in his Understanding to imagine, conceive, or think of the Things of
God, or actually to perform them by preaching or praying.
<span class="sidenote"><i>True</i> Christianity, <i>wherein it consists not</i>.</span>The
<i>First</i> is a Missing both in Matter and Form; the <i>Second</i> is a Retaining
of the Form without the Life and Substance of <i>Christianity</i>; because
<i>Christian Religion</i> consisteth not in a mere Belief of true <i>Doctrines</i>, or a
mere Performance of <i>Acts</i> good in themselves, or else the bare Letter
of the Scripture, though spoken by a <i>Drunkard</i>, or a <i>Devil</i>, might be
said to be <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Life</i>, which I judge none will be so absurd as to affirm;
and also it would follow, that where the Form of Godliness is, there
the Power is also, which is contrary to the express Words of the
Apostle. For the Form of Godliness cannot be said to be, where
either the Notions and Opinions believed are erroneous and ungodly,
or the Acts performed evil and wicked; for then it would be the
Form of Ungodliness, and not of Godliness: But of this more hereafter,
when we shall speak particularly of Preaching and Praying.
Now though this last be not so bad as the former, yet it hath made
Way for it; for Men having first departed from the Life and Sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>stance
of true <i>Religion</i> and <i>Worship</i>, to wit, from the inward Power
and Virtue of the Spirit, so as therein to act, and thereby to have
all their Actions enlivened, have only retained the Form and Shew,
to wit, the true Words and Appearance; and so acting in their
own natural and unrenewed Wills in this Form, the Form could
not but quickly decay, and be vitiated. For the working and active
Spirit of Man could not contain itself within the Simplicity
and Plainness of Truth, but giving Way to his own numerous Inventions
and Imaginations, began to vary in the Form, and adapt
it to his own Inventions, until by Degrees the Form of Godliness
for the most Part came to be lost, as well as the Power.
<span class="sidenote">Idolatry<i> does hug its own Conceivings.</i></span>For this
Kind of <i>Idolatry</i>, whereby Man loveth, idolizeth, and embraceth
his own Conceptions, Inventions, and Product of his own Brain,
is so incident unto him, and feared in his fallen Nature, that so
long as his natural Spirit is the first Author and Actor of him, and
is that by which he only is guided and moved in his Worship towards
God, so as not first to wait for another Guide to direct him,
he can never perform the pure spiritual Worship, nor bring forth
any Thing but the Fruit of the first, fallen, natural, and corrupt
Root. Wherefore the Time appointed of God being come, wherein
by <i>Jesus Christ</i> he hath been pleased to restore the true <i>spiritual Worship</i>,
and the outward Form of <i>Worship</i>, which was appointed by God
to the <i>Jews</i>, and whereof the Manner and Time of its Performance
was particularly determined by God himself, being come to an
End,
<span class="sidenote"><i>No Form of </i>Worship<i> but the Spirit prescribed by Christ.</i></span>we find that <i>Jesus Christ</i>, the Author of the <i>Christian Religion</i>,
prescribes no <i>set Form of Worship</i> to his Children, under the more
pure Administration of the <i>New Covenant</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> save that he only tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
them, That the <i>Worship now to be performed is spiritual</i>, and <i>in the Spirit</i>.
And it is especially to be observed, that in the whole <i>New Testament</i>
there is no Order nor Command given in this Thing, but
to follow the Revelation of the Spirit, save only that general one of
<i>meeting together</i>; a Thing dearly owned and diligently practised by
us, as shall hereafter more appear.
<span class="sidenote">Pray, preach,<i> and </i>sing<i> in Spirit.</i></span>True it is, Mention is made
of the Duties of <i>Praying</i>, <i>Preaching</i>, and <i>Singing</i>; but what Order
or Method should be kept in so doing, or that presently they should
be set about so soon as the Saints are gathered, there is not one
Word to be found: Yea, these Duties, as shall afterwards be made
appear, are always annexed to the Assistance, Leadings, and Motions
of God’s Spirit. Since then Man in his natural State is thus
excluded from acting or moving in Things <i>spiritual</i>, how or what
Way shall he exercise this first and previous Duty of <i>waiting upon
God</i> but by <i>Silence</i>, and by bringing that natural Part to <i>Silence</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>To </i>wait on God<i>, by what it is performed.</i></span>Which is no other Ways but by abstaining from his own Thoughts
and Imaginations, and from all the Self-workings and Motions of
his own Mind, as well in Things materially <i>good</i> as <i>evil</i>; that he
being <i>silent</i>, God may <i>speak in him</i>, and the <i>good Seed</i> may arise. This,
though hard to the natural Man, is so answerable to Reason, and
even natural Experience in other Things, that it cannot be denied.
He that cometh to learn of a Master, if he expect to hear his Master
and be instructed by him, must not continually be speaking of
the Matter to be taught, and never be quiet, otherwise how shall
his Master have Time to instruct him?
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Simile of a Master and his Scholar.</i></span>Yea, though the Scholar
were never so earnest to learn the <i>Science</i>, yet would the Master have
Reason to reprove him, as untoward and indocile, if he would always
be meddling of himself, and still speaking, and not wait in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
Silence patiently to hear his Master instructing and teaching him,
who ought not to open his Mouth until by his Master he were commanded
and allowed so to do.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of a Prince and his Servant.</i></span>So also if one were about to attend
a great Prince, he would be thought an impertinent and imprudent
Servant, who, while he ought patiently and readily to wait, that
he might answer the King when he speaks, and have his Eye upon
him to observe the least Motions and Inclinations of his Will, and
to do accordingly, would be still deafening him with Discourse,
though it were in Praises of him; and running to and fro, without
any particular and immediate Order, to do Things that perhaps
might be good in themselves, or might have been commanded at
other Times to others. Would the Kings of the Earth accept of
such Servants or Service?
<span class="sidenote"><i>To wait in Silence.</i></span>Since then we are commanded to <i>wait
upon God diligently</i>, and in so doing it is promised that our <i>Strength
shall be renewed</i>, this <i>Waiting</i> cannot be performed but by a <i>Silence</i> or
<i>Cessation</i> of the natural Part on our Side, since God manifests himself
not to the outward Man or Senses, so much as to the inward,
to wit, to the Soul and Spirit.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The thinking busy Soul excludes the Voice of God.</i></span>If the Soul be still thinking and
working in her own Will, and busily exercised in her own Imaginations,
though the Matters as in themselves may be <i>good</i> concerning
God, yet thereby she incapacitates herself from discerning the <i>still,
small Voice</i> of the Spirit, and so hurts herself greatly, in that she
neglects her chief Business of <i>waiting upon the Lord</i>: Nothing less than
if I should busy myself, crying out and speaking of a Business, while
in the mean Time I neglect to hear one who is quietly whispering
into my Ear, and informing me in those Things which are most
needful for me to hear and know concerning that Business. And
since it is the chief Work of a <i>Christian</i> to know the <i>natural Will</i> in its
own proper Motions <i>crucified</i>, that God may both move in the Act
and in the Will, the Lord chiefly regards this profound Subjection
and Self-denial.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Religious Speculations.</i></span>For some Men please themselves as much, and
gratify their own sensual Wills and Humours in high and curious
<i>Speculations</i> of <i>Religion</i>, affecting a Name and Reputation that Way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
or because those Things by Custom or otherways are become pleasant
and habitual to them, though not a Whit more regenerated
or inwardly sanctified in their Spirits,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Sensual Recreations.</i></span>as others gratify their Lusts
in <i>Acts</i> of <i>Sensuality</i>, and therefore both are alike hurtful to Men,
and sinful in the Sight of God, it being nothing but the mere Fruit
and Effect of Man’s natural and unrenewed Will and Spirit.
<span class="sidenote">Thoughts<i> of Death and Hell to keep out </i>Sin<i> are Fig-leaves.</i></span>Yea,
should one, as many no Doubt do, from a Sense of Sin, and Fear
of Punishment, seek to terrify themselves from Sin, by multiplying
Thoughts of Death, Hell, and Judgment, and by presenting to their
Imaginations the Happiness and Joys of Heaven, and also by multiplying
Prayers and other religious Performances, as these Things
could never deliver him from one Iniquity, without the secret and
inward Power of God’s Spirit and Grace, so would they signify no
more than the <i>Fig-leaves</i> wherewith <i>Adam</i> thought to cover his <i>Nakedness</i>.
And seeing it is only the Product of Man’s own natural Will,
proceeding from a Self-love, and seeking to save himself, and not
arising purely from that <i>divine Seed</i> of <i>Righteousness</i> which is given of
God to all for Grace and Salvation, it is rejected of God, and no
Ways acceptable unto him; since the natural Man, as natural,
while he stands in that State, is, with all his Arts, Parts, and Actings,
reprobated by him.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Denial of one’s Self.</i></span>This great Duty then of waiting upon
God, must needs be exercised in Man’s denying Self, both inwardly
and outwardly, in a still and mere Dependence upon God, in abstracting
from all the Workings, Imaginations, and Speculations
of his own Mind, that being emptied as it were of himself, and so
throughly crucified to the natural Products thereof, he may be fit
to receive the Lord, who will have no Co-partner nor Co-rival of
his Glory and Power. And Man being thus stated, the little Seed
of Righteousness which God hath planted in his Soul, and Christ
hath purchased for him, even the Measure of <i>Grace</i> and <i>Life</i>, which
is burdened and crucified by Man’s natural <i>Thoughts</i> and <i>Imaginations</i>,
receives a Place to arise, and becometh a holy Birth and Geniture
<i>in</i> Man;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The holy Birth.</i></span>and is that <i>divine Air</i> in and by which Man’s Soul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
Spirit comes to be leavened; and by waiting therein he comes to
be accepted in the Sight of God, to stand in his Presence, hear his
Voice, and observe the Motions of his holy Spirit. And so Man’s
Place is to wait in this; and as hereby there are any Objects presented
to his Mind concerning God, or Things relating to Religion,
his Soul may be exercised in them without Hurt, and to the great
Profit both of himself and others; because those Things have their Rise
not from his own Will, but from God’s Spirit: And therefore as in
the Arisings and Movings of this his Mind is still to be exercised in
thinking and meditating, so also in the more obvious Acts of Preaching
and Praying.
<span class="sidenote"><i>No </i>Quakers<i> are against a meditating Mind.</i></span>And so it may hence appear we are not against
Meditation, as some have sought falsely to infer from our Doctrine;
<span class="sidenote"><i>From Nature’s Thoughts all Errors rise.</i></span>but we are against the <i>Thoughts</i> and <i>Imaginations</i> of the natural Man
in his own Will, from which all Errors and Heresies concerning the
Christian Religion in the whole World have proceeded. But if it
please God at any Time, when one or more are waiting upon him,
not to present such Objects as give them Occasion to exercise their
Minds in <i>Thoughts</i> and <i>Imaginations</i>, but purely to keep them in this
holy Dependence, and as they persist therein, to cause his secret
Refreshment and the pure Incomes of his holy Life to flow in upon
them, then they have good Reason to be content, because by this,
as we know by good and blessed Experience, the Soul is more
strengthened, renewed, and confirmed in the Love of God, and
armed against the Power of Sin, than any Way else;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Soul renewed, </i>by what?<i> The holy Life of God.</i></span>this being a
Fore-taste of that real and sensible Enjoyment of God, which the
Saints in Heaven daily possess, which God frequently affords to his
Children here for their Comfort and Encouragement, especially
when they are assembled together to <i>wait upon him</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> If any object here, <i>That the Lord’s Prayer is a prescribed Form of Prayer, and therefore of </i>Worship<i>
given by Christ to his Children</i>:</p></div>

<p>I answer, <i>First</i>, This cannot be objected by any Sort of <i>Christians</i> that I know, because there
are none who use not other Prayers, or that limit their Worship to this. <i>Secondly</i>, This was
commanded to the Disciples, while yet weak, before they had received the Dispensation of
the Gospel; not that they should only use it in praying, but that he might shew them by one
Example how that their Prayers ought to be short, and not like the long Prayers of the Pharisees.
And that this was the Use of it, appears by all their Prayers, which divers Saints afterwards
made use of, whereof the Scripture makes mention; for none made use of this, neither
repeated it, but used other Words, according as the Thing required, and as the Spirit gave
Utterance. <i>Thirdly</i>, That this ought to be so understood, appears from <i>Rom.</i> viii. 26. of which
afterwards Mention shall be made at greater Length, where the Apostle saith, <i>We know not
what we <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: shall">should</span> pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh Intercession for us</i>, &amp;c. But if this Prayer
had been such a prescribed Form of Prayer to the <i>Church</i>, that had not been true, neither
had they been ignorant what to pray, nor should they have needed the Help of the Spirit to
teach them.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whatever Man does act without the Power of God, is not accepted.</i></span>For there are <i>two contrary Powers</i> or <i>Spirits</i>, to wit, the
<i>Power</i> and <i>Spirit of this World</i>, in which the Prince of Darkness bears
Rule, and over as many as are acted by it, and work from it; and
the <i>Power</i> or <i>Spirit of God</i>, in which God worketh and beareth Rule,
and over as many as act in and from it. So whatever be the Things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
that a Man thinketh of, or acteth in, however <i>spiritual</i> or <i>religious</i>
as to the Notion or Form of them, so long as he acteth and moveth
in the natural and corrupt Spirit and Will, and not from, in, and
by the Power of God, he sinneth in all, and is not accepted of God.
For hence both the <a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a><i>Plowing</i> and Praying <i>of the Wicked is Sin</i>; as also
whatever a Man acts in and from the Spirit and Power of God,
having his Understanding and Will influenced and moved by it,
whether it be Actions <i>religious</i>, <i>civil</i>, or even <i>natural</i>, he is accepted
in so doing in the Sight of God, and is <a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><i>blessed in them</i>. From what
is said it doth appear how frivolous and impertinent their <i>Objection</i>
is, that say they <i>wait upon God in Praying and Preaching</i>, since <i>Waiting</i>
<span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: both">doth</span> of itself imply a <i>passive Dependence</i>, rather than an <i>acting</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>To pray and preach without the Spirit is Offence to God.</i></span>And
since it is, and shall yet be more shewn, that <i>Preaching</i> and <i>Praying</i>
without the Spirit is an Offending of God, not a Waiting upon him,
and that <i>Praying</i> and <i>Preaching</i> by the Spirit pre-supposes necessarily
a <i>silent Waiting</i> to feel the Motions and Influence of the Spirit to lead
thereunto; and <i>Lastly</i>, that in several of these Places where Praying is
commanded, as <i>Matt.</i> xxvi. 41. <i>Mark</i> xiii. 33. <i>Luke</i> xxi. 36. 1 <i>Peter</i>
iv. 7. Watching is specially prefixed as a previous Preparation thereunto;
we do well and certainly conclude, that since <i>Waiting</i> and <i>Watching</i>
are so particularly commanded and recommended, and cannot
be truly performed but in this <i>inward Silence</i> of the Mind from Men’s
own Thoughts and Imaginations, this <i>Silence</i> is and must necessarily
be a special and principal Part of <i>God’s Worship</i>.</div>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">II. <i>This </i>silent Waiting<i> the Devil cannot counterfeit.</i></span>
But <i>Secondly</i>, The <i>Excellency</i> of this <i>silent Waiting upon God</i>
doth appear, in that it is impossible for the <i>Enemy</i>, viz. the <i>Devil</i>,
to counterfeit it, so as for any Soul to be deceived or deluded by
him in the Exercise thereof. Now in all other Matters he may mix
himself with the natural Mind of Man, and so by <i>transforming</i>
himself he may deceive the Soul, by busying it about Things
perhaps innocent in themselves, while yet he keeps them from beholding
the <i>pure Light of Christ</i>, and so from knowing distinctly their
Duty, and doing of it. For that envious Spirit of Man’s eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
Happiness knoweth well how to accommodate himself, and fit his
Snares for all the several Dispositions and Inclinations of Men; if
he find one not fit to be engaged with gross Sins, or worldly Lusts,
but rather averse from them, and religiously inclined, he can fit
himself to beguile such a one, by suffering his Thoughts and Imaginations
to run upon <i>spiritual Matters</i>, and so hurry him to work, act,
and meditate in his own Will. For he well knoweth that so long
as <i>Self</i> bears Rule, and the <i>Spirit of God</i> is not the principal and chief
Actor, Man is not put out of his Reach;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Altar, Prayers, Pulpit, Study, cannot shut the Devil out.</i></span>so therefore he can accompany
the <i>Priest</i> to the <i>Altar</i>, the <i>Preacher</i> to the <i>Pulpit</i>, the <i>Zealot</i> to
his <i>Prayers</i>, yea, the <i>Doctor</i> and <i>Professor of Divinity</i> to his <i>Study</i>, and
there he can chearfully suffer him to labour and work among his
Books, yea, and help him to find out and invent subtile Distinctions
and Quiddities, by which both his Mind, and others through him,
may be kept from heeding <i>God’s Light in the Conscience</i>, and waiting
upon him. There is not any Exercise whatsoever, wherein he cannot
enter, and have a chief Place, so as the Soul many Times cannot
discern it, except in this alone: For he can only work in and
by the natural Man, and his Faculties, by secretly acting upon his
Imaginations and Desires, <i>&amp;c.</i> and therefore, when he (to wit, the
natural Man) is silent, there he must also stand. And therefore
when the Soul comes to this <i>Silence</i>, and as it were is brought to
Nothingness, as to her own Workings, then the Devil is shut out;
for the <i>pure Presence of God</i> and <i>Shining</i> of his <i>Light</i> he cannot abide,
because so long as a Man is thinking and meditating as of himself,
he cannot be sure, but the Devil is influencing him therein; but
when he comes wholly to be silent, as the <i>pure Light of God</i> shines
in upon him, then he is sure that the Devil is shut out; for beyond
the Imaginations he cannot go, which we often find by sensible Experience.
For he that of old is said to have come to the <i>Gathering
together</i> of the <i>Children of God</i>, is not wanting to come to our <i>Assemblies</i>.
And indeed he can well enter and work in a Meeting,
that is silent only as to Words, either by keeping the Minds in va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>rious
Thoughts and Imaginations, or by stupifying them, so as to
overwhelm them with a Spirit of Heaviness and Slothfulness: But when
we retire out of all, and are turned in, both by being <i>diligent</i> and
<i>watchful</i> upon the one Hand, and also <i>silent</i> and <i>retired</i> out of all our
Thoughts upon the other, as we abide in this sure Place, we feel ourselves
out of his Reach. Yea, oftentimes the <i>Power</i> and <i>Glory</i> of God
will break forth and appear, just as the bright Sun through many
Clouds and Mists, to the Dispelling of that Power of Darkness; which
will also be sensibly felt, seeking to cloud and darken the Mind,
and wholly to keep it from <i>purely waiting</i> upon God.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">III. <i>The Worship of the</i> Quakers <i>not stopt or interrupted by Men or Devils.</i></span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, The <i>Excellency</i> of this <i>Worship</i> doth appear, in that
it can neither be stopt nor interrupted by the Malice of Men or Devils,
as all others can. Now Interruptions and Stoppings of Worship
may be understood in a twofold Respect, either as we are hindered
from <i>meeting</i>, as being outwardly by Violence separated one
from another; or when permitted to <i>meet together</i>, as we are interrupted
by the Tumult, Noise, and Confusion which such as are
malicious may use to molest or distract us. Now in both these Respects,
this Worship doth greatly surpass all others: For how far
soever People be separate or hindered from coming together, yet as
every one is inwardly gathered to the Measure of <i>Life</i> in himself,
there is a secret Unity and Fellowship enjoyed, which the Devil and
all his Instruments can never break or hinder. But, <i>Secondly</i>, It doth
as well appear, as to those Molestations which occur, when we are
met together, what Advantage this <i>true</i> and <i>spiritual Worship</i> gives
us beyond all others; seeing in Despite of a thousand Interruptions
and Abuses, one of which were sufficient to have stopt all other
Sorts of <i>Christians</i>, we have been able, through the Nature of this
<i>Worship</i>, to keep it uninterrupted as to God, and also at the same
Time to shew forth an Example of our <i>Christian Patience</i> towards all,
even oftentimes to the Reaching and Convincing of our Opposers.
For there is no Sort of Worship used by others which can subsist
(though they be permitted to meet) unless they be either authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>

Arm of Flesh: But we at the same Time exercise Worship towards
God, and also patiently bear the Reproaches and Ignominies which
<i>Christ prophesied</i> should be so incident and frequent to Christians.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Worship<i> of the Papists soon interrupted.</i></span>For
how can the <i>Papists</i> say their <i>Mass</i>, if there be any there to disturb
and interrupt them? Do but take away the <i>Mass-book</i>, the <i>Chalice</i>, the
<i>Host</i>, or the <i>Priest’s Garments</i>, yea, do but spill the <i>Water</i>, or the
<i>Wine</i>, or blow out the <i>Candles</i> (a Thing quickly done) and the whole
Business is marred, and no Sacrifice can be offered.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestants<i> the like, and </i>Anabaptists.</span>Take from the
<i>Lutherans</i> or <i>Episcopalians</i> their <i>Liturgy</i> or <i>Common-Prayer-Book</i>, and no
Service can be said. Remove from the <i>Calvinists</i>, <i>Arminians</i>, <i>Socinians</i>,
<i>Independents</i>, or <i>Anabaptists</i>, the <i>Pulpit</i>, the <i>Bible</i>, and the <i>Hour-glass</i>,
or make but such a Noise as the Voice of the <i>Preacher</i> cannot be
heard, or disturb him but so before he come, or strip him of his
<i>Bible</i> or his <i>Books</i>, and he must be dumb: For they all think it an
Heresy to wait to speak as the Spirit of God giveth Utterance; and
thus easily their whole Worship may be marred. But when People
meet together, and their Worship consisteth not in such outward Acts,
and they depend not upon any one’s Speaking, but merely sit down
to wait upon God, and to be gathered out of all Visibles, and to
feel the Lord in Spirit, none of these Things can hinder them, of
which we may say of a Truth, <i>We are sensible Witnesses</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Sufferings of the </i>Quakers<i> for their religious Meetings.</i></span>For when the
<i>Magistrates</i>, stirred up by the Malice and Envy of our Opposers, have
used all Means possible (and yet in vain) to deter us from meeting
together, and that openly and publickly in our own hired Houses
for that Purpose, both Death, Banishments, Imprisonments, Finings,
Beatings, Whippings, and other such devilish Inventions, have
proved ineffectual to terrify us from our <i>holy Assemblies</i>. And we
having, I say, thus oftentimes purchased our Liberty to meet, by <i>deep
Sufferings</i>, our Opposers have then taken another Way, by turning
in upon us the worst and wickedest People, yea, the very Off-scourings
of Men, who by all manner of <i>inhuman, beastly</i>, and <i>brutish Behaviour</i>,
have sought to provoke us, weary us, and molest us, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
in vain. It would be almost incredible to declare, and indeed a
Shame, that among Men pretending to be <i>Christians</i>, it should be
mentioned, what Things of this Kind Men’s Eyes have seen, and I
myself, with others, have shared of in Suffering! There they have
often beaten us, and cast Water and Dirt upon <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: up">us</span>; there they have
danced, leaped, sung, and spoken all manner of profane and ungodly
Words; offered Violence and shameful Behaviour to grave Women and
Virgins; jeered, mocked and scoffed, asking us, <i>If the Spirit was not yet
come?</i> And much more, which were tedious here to relate: And all
this while we have been seriously and silently sitting together, and
waiting upon the Lord. So that by these Things our inward and spiritual
Fellowship with God, and one with another, in the <i>pure Life of
Righteousness</i>, hath not been hindered. But on the contrary, the Lord
knowing our Sufferings and Reproaches for his Testimony’s Sake,
hath caused his Power and Glory more to abound among us, and
hath mightily refreshed us by the Sense of his Love, which hath filled
our Souls; and so much the rather, as we found ourselves gathered
into the <i>Name of the Lord</i>, which is the <a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><i>strong Tower of the Righteous</i>;
whereby we felt ourselves sheltered from receiving any inward Hurt
through their Malice: And also that he had delivered us from that
vain Name and Profession of <i>Christianity</i>, under which our Opposers
were not ashamed to bring forth those bitter and cursed Fruits.
Yea, sometimes in the Midst of this Tumult and Opposition, God
would <i>powerfully move</i> some or other of us by his Spirit, both to testify
of that <i>Joy</i>, which notwithstanding their Malice we enjoyed,
and powerfully to declare, in the Evidence and Demonstration of
the Spirit, against their <i>Folly</i> and <i>Wickedness</i>; so as the Power of Truth
hath brought them to some Measure of Quietness and Stillness, and
stopt the impetuous Streams of their <i>Fury</i> and <i>Madness</i>:
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Rod</i> of <i>Moses</i> divided the <i>Sea: The Spirit maketh Way through the raging Waves.</i></span>That even

<span class="sidenote"><i>How the </i>Old Covenant-worship<i> doth differ from the </i>New.</span>Moreover, in this we know, that we are Partakers of
the <i>New Covenant’s Dispensation</i>, and <i>Disciples of Christ</i> indeed, sharing
with him in that <i>spiritual Worship</i>, which is performed in the <i>Spirit</i>
and in <i>Truth</i>; because as he was, so are we in this World. For the
<i>Old Covenant-worship</i> had an outward <i>Glory, Temple</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i>, and
was full of outward <i>Splendor</i> and <i>Majesty</i>, having an outward <i>Tabernacle</i>
and <i>Altar</i>, beautified with <i>Gold, Silver</i>, and <i>precious Stones</i>; and
their <i>Sacrifices</i> were confined to a particular Place, even the outward
<i>Mount Sion</i>; and those that prayed, were to pray with their Faces
towards that outward <i>Temple</i>: And therefore all this was to be protected
by an outward Arm. Nor could the <i>Jews</i> peaceably have enjoyed
it, but when they were secured from the <i>Violence</i> of their outward
<i>Enemies</i>: And therefore when at any Time their <i>Enemies</i> prevailed
over them, their <i>Glory</i> was darkened, and their <i>Sacrifices</i> stopt;
and the <i>Face</i> of their <i>Worship</i> marred: Hence they complain, lament,
and bewail the Destroying of the <i>Temple</i>, as a Loss irreparable.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The New Covenant-worship is inward.</i></span>But
<i>Jesus Christ</i>, the Author and Institutor of the <i>New Covenant-worship</i>,
testifies, that <i>God</i> is neither to be <i>worshiped</i> in this nor that Place,
but in the <i>Spirit</i> and in <i>Truth</i>: <a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>And forasmuch as his <i>Kingdom is not

<i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Glory</i>, <i>Riches</i> or <i>Splendor</i> of this World to beautify or adorn
it; nor yet the outward <i>Power</i> or <i>Arm</i> of <i>Flesh</i> to maintain, uphold,
or protect it; but it is and may be performed by those that are <i>spiritually-minded</i>,
notwithstanding all the <i>Opposition</i>, <i>Violence</i>, and <i>Malice</i>
of Men; because being purely <i>spiritual</i>, it is out of the Reach of
natural Men to interrupt or obstruct it. Even as <i>Jesus Christ</i>, the
Author thereof, did enjoy and possess his <i>spiritual Kingdom</i>, while oppressed,
persecuted, and rejected of <i>Men</i>; and as, in despite of the
Malice and Rage of the <i>Devil</i>, <a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><i>he spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphing
over them, and through Death destroyed him that had the Power of

<i>worship</i> him, not only without the Arm of Flesh to protect them, but
even when oppressed. For their <i>Worship</i> being <i>spiritual</i>, is by the
Power of the Spirit defended and maintained;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Carnal Worships cannot stand without the Arm of Flesh.</i></span>but such <i>Worships</i> as
are <i>carnal</i>, and consist in <i>carnal</i> and <i>outward Ceremonies</i> and <i>Observations</i>,
need a carnal and outward Arm to protect and defend them,
else they cannot stand and subsist. And therefore it appears, that
the several <i>Worships</i> of our <i>Opposers</i>, both <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, are of
this Kind, and not the true <i>spiritual</i> and <i>New Covenant-worship</i> of
<i>Christ</i>; because, as hath been observed, they cannot stand without
the Protection or Countenance of the outward <i>Magistrate</i>, neither
can be performed, if there be the least Opposition: For they are
not in the Patience of <i>Jesus</i>, to serve and worship him with <i>Sufferings</i>,
<i>Ignominies</i>, <i>Calumnies</i>, and <i>Reproaches</i>. And from hence have
sprung all those <i>Wars</i>, <i>Fightings</i>, and <i>Bloodshed</i> among <i>Christians</i>, while
each by the Arm of Flesh endeavoured to defend and protect their

<span class="sidenote">IV. <i>True Worship in Spirit established by Christ.</i></span>But <i>Fourthly</i>, The Nature of this Worship, which is performed
by the Operation of the <i>Spirit</i>, the natural Man being silent,
doth appear from these Words of Christ, <i>John</i> iv. 23, 24. <i>But the
Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worshippers shall worship the Fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>ther
in Spirit and in Truth: For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God
is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in
Truth.</i> This Testimony is the more specially to be observed, for
that it is both the <i>first</i>, <i>chiefest</i>, and <i>most ample Testimony</i>, which <i>Christ</i>
gives us of his <i>Christian Worship</i>, as different and contra-distinguished
from that under the <i>Law</i>. For first, he sheweth that the Season is
now come, wherein the <i>Worship must be in Spirit and in Truth; for the
Father seeketh such to worship him</i>: So then it is no more a Worship
consisting in outward Observations, to be performed by Man at set
<i>Times</i> or <i>Opportunities</i>, which he can do in his own Will, and by his
own natural Strength; for else it would not differ in Matter, but
only in some Circumstances from that under the <i>Law</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Reason Christ gives for a </i>Worship<i> in </i>Spirit.</span>Next, as for
a Reason of this <i>Worship</i>, we need not give any other, and indeed
none can give a better than that which <i>Christ</i> giveth, which I think
should be sufficient to satisfy every <i>Christian</i>, to wit, GOD IS A
SPIRIT, <i>and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and
in Truth</i>. As this ought to be received, because it is the Words of
<i>Christ</i>, so also it is founded upon so clear a Demonstration of Reason,
as sufficiently evidenceth its <i>Verity</i>. For Christ excellently argues
from the <i>Analogy</i> that ought to be betwixt the <i>Object</i>, and the <i>Worship</i>
directed thereunto:</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span><i>God is a Spirit</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore <i>he must be worshipped in</i> Spirit.</p>

<p>This is so certain, that it can suffer no Contradiction; yea, and
this Analogy is so necessary to be minded, that under the <i>Law</i>,
when God instituted and appointed that ceremonial Worship to
the <i>Jews</i>, because that Worship was outward, that there might be
an <i>Analogy</i>, he saw it necessary to condescend to them as in a
special Manner, to dwell betwixt the <i>Cherubims</i> within the <i>Tabernacle</i>,
and afterwards to make the <i>Temple</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i> in a Sort his
Habitation, and cause something of an <i>outward Glory</i> and <i>Majesty</i> to
appear, by causing Fire from <i>Heaven</i> to consume the <i>Sacrifices</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
filling the <i>Temple</i> with a <i>Cloud</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Glory of the outward Temple.</i></span>Through and by which <i>Mediums</i>, visible
to the outward Eye, he manifested himself proportionably to
that outward Worship which he had commanded them to perform.
So now under the <i>New Covenant</i>, he seeing meet in his heavenly
Wisdom to lead his Children in a Path more <i>heavenly</i> and <i>spiritual</i>,
and in a Way more easy and familiar, and also purposing to disappoint
<i>carnal</i> and <i>outward Observations</i>, that his may have an Eye more
to an <i>inward Glory</i> and <i>Kingdom</i> than to an <i>outward</i>, he hath given
us for an Example hereof the Appearance of his beloved Son, the
Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="sidenote"><i>As </i>Moses<i> did from outward, so </i>Christ<i> delivers <span class="correction" title="In the original book: his">us</span> from inward Slavery.</i></span>who (as <i>Moses</i> delivered the <i>Israelites</i> out of their
<i>outward Bondage</i>, and by <i>outwardly destroying</i> their Enemies) hath
delivered and doth deliver us by suffering, and dying by the Hands
of his <i>Enemies</i>; thereby triumphing over the <i>Devil</i>, and his and our
inward <i>Enemies</i>, and delivering us therefrom. He hath also instituted
an <i>inward</i> and <i>spiritual Worship</i>: So that God now tieth not
his People to the <i>Temple</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, nor yet unto outward <i>Ceremonies</i>
and <i>Observations</i>; but taketh the Heart of every <i>Christian</i> for a
<i>Temple</i> to dwell in; and there immediately appeareth, and giveth
him Directions how to serve him in any outward Acts. Since, as
Christ argueth, <i>God is a Spirit</i>, he will now be worshipped in the
Spirit, where he reveals himself, and dwelleth with the <i>contrite in
Heart</i>. Now, since it is the <i>Heart of Man</i> that now is become the
<i>Temple of God</i>, in which he will be worshipped, and no more in
particular outward Temples, (since, as blessed <i>Stephen</i> said, out of
the Prophet, to the professing <i>Jews</i> of old, <i>The most High dwelleth not
in Temples made with Hands</i>) as before the <i>Glory of the Lord</i> descended
to fill the outward Temple, it behoved to be purified and cleansed,
and all polluted Stuff removed out of it; yea, and the Place for the
Tabernacle was overlaid with Gold, the most precious and cleanest
of Metals; so also before God be worshipped in the inward Temple
of the Heart, it must also be purged of its own Filth, and all its
own Thoughts and Imaginations, that so it may be fit to receive
the Spirit of God, and to be actuated by it. And doth not this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span>
directly lead us to that <i>inward Silence</i>, of which we have spoken, and
exactly pointed out? And further, This Worship must be <i>in Truth</i>;
intimating, that this spiritual Worship, thus actuated, is only and
properly a true Worship; as being that which, for the Reasons
above observed, cannot be counterfeited by the Enemy, nor yet performed
by the Hypocrite.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVI.</h3> And though this <i>Worship</i> be indeed very different from
the divers established invented Worships among <i>Christians</i>, and therefore
may seem strange to many, yet hath it been testified of, commended
and practised, by the most pious of all Sorts, in all Ages,
as by many evident Testimonies might be proved. So that from
the professing and practising thereof, the Name of <i>Mysticks</i> hath
arisen, as of a certain Sect, generally commended by all, whose
<i>Writings</i> are full both of the Explanation and of the Commendation
of this Sort of <i>Worship</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>A certain Sect of </i>Mysticks<i> among the </i>Papists<i>, their </i>inward Exercise<i>. See </i>Sancta Sophia<i>, printed </i>An. Dom. 1657.</span>where they plentifully assert this <i>inward Introversion</i>
and <i>Abstraction of the Mind</i>, as they call it, <i>from all Images
and Thoughts</i>, and the <i>Prayer of the Will</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>English Benedictines<i> Testimony for the spiritual Worship, against their Masses and set Devotions.</i></span>Yea, they look upon this as
the <i>Height</i> of <i>Christian Perfection</i>; so that some of them, though professed
<i>Papists</i>, do not doubt to affirm, <i>That such as have attained this
Method of Worship, or are aiming at it</i>, (as in a Book, called <i>Sancta Sophia</i>,
put out by the <i>English Benedictines</i>, printed at <i>Doway</i>, <i>Anno 1657</i>.
Tract. I. Sect. 2. Cap. 5.) <i>need not, nor ought to trouble or busy themselves
with frequent and unnecessary Confessions, with exercising corporal
Labours and Austerities, the using of vocal voluntary Prayers, the hearing of a
Number of Masses, or set Devotions, or Exercises to Saints, or Prayers for
the Dead, or having solicitous and distracting Cares to gain Indulgences, by
going to such and such Churches, or adjoining one’s Self to Confraternities,
or intangling one’s Self with Vows and Promises; because such Kind of Things
hinder the Soul from observing the Operations of the divine Spirit in it, and
from having Liberty to follow the Spirit whither it would draw her</i>. And
yet who knows not that in such Kind of Observations the very Substance
of the <i>Popish Religion</i> consisteth? Yet nevertheless, it appears
by this, and many other Passages, which out of their <i>Mystick Writers</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
might be mentioned, how they look upon this <i>Worship</i> as excelling
all other; and that such as arrived hereunto, had no absolute Need
of the others: Yea, (see the Life of <i>Balthazar Alvares</i>, in the same
<i>Sancta Sophia</i>, Tract. III. Sect. 1. Cap. 7.) such as tasted of this,
quickly confessed, that the other <i>Forms</i> and <i>Ceremonies of Worship</i>
were useless as to them; neither did they perform them as Things
necessary, but merely for Order or Example’s Sake. And therefore,
though some of them were so overclouded with the common
Darkness of their Profession, yet could they affirm that this <i>spiritual
Worship</i> was still to be retained and sought for, even though it
should become necessary to omit their outward Ceremonies.
<span class="sidenote">Bernard<i> preferring the </i>Spirit<i> above </i>Popish Orders.</span>Hence
<i>Bernard</i>, as in <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: may">many</span> other Places, so in his <i>Epistle</i> to <i>William</i>, Abbot
of the same Order, saith, <i>Take Heed to the Rule of God; the Kingdom of
God is within you</i>: And afterwards, saying, That their outward Orders
and Rules should be observed, he adds; <i>But otherwise, when it
shall happen that one of these two must be omitted, in such a Case these are
much rather to be omitted than those former: For by how much the Spirit is
more excellent and noble than the Body, by so much are spiritual Exercises
more profitable than corporal</i>. Is not that then the best of Worships,
which the best of Men in all Ages, and of all Sects, have commended,
and which is most suitable to the Doctrine of Christ? I
say, Is not that Worship to be followed and performed? And so
much the rather, as God hath raised a People to testify for it, and
preach it, to their great Refreshment and Strengthening, in the
very Face of the World, and notwithstanding much Opposition;
who do not, as these <i>Mysticks</i>, make of it a Mystery, only to be attained
by a few Men or Women in a Cloister;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Those </i>Mysticks<i> did confine that Mystery to a Cloister.</i></span>or, as their Mistake
was, after wearying themselves with many outward <i>Ceremonies</i>
and <i>Observations</i>, as if it were the Consequence of such a Labour;
but who in the free Love of God (who respects not Persons, and
was near to hear and reveal himself, as well to <i>Cornelius</i>, a Centurion
and a Roman, as to <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Anna</i>; and who discovered

rather than to the <i>High Priests</i> and <i>devout Proselytes</i> among the <i>Jews</i>)
in and according to his <i>free Love</i>, finding that God is revealing and
establishing this Worship, and making many poor Tradesmen, yea,
young Boys and Girls, Witnesses of it, do intreat and beseech
all to lay aside their own Will-worships, and voluntary Acts, performed
in their own Wills, and by their own mere natural Strength
and Power, without retiring out of their vain Imaginations and
Thoughts, or feeling the <i>pure Spirit of God</i> to move and stir in
them; that they may come to practise this acceptable Worship,
which is <i>in Spirit and in Truth</i>. But against this Worship they object.</div>

every one stay at Home, until they be particularly moved to go to such a

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, <i>First</i>, To meet at set Times and Places is not any <i>religious

<span class="sidenote"><i>Publick Meetings their Use and Reason asserted.</i></span>but only an <i>outward Conveniency</i>,
necessary for our seeing one another, so long as we are

Accommodation of our outward Man, in order to a publick visible
<i>Worship</i>; since we set not about the visible Acts of <i>Worship</i> when we

God hath seen meet, so long as his <i>Children</i> are in this <i>World</i>,
to make use of the outward Senses, not only as a Means to convey
<i>spiritual Life</i>, as by <i>Speaking</i>, <i>Praying</i>, <i>Praising</i>, &amp;c. which cannot be
done to mutual Edification, but when we hear and see one another;
but also to entertain an outward, visible <i>Testimony</i> for his Name in
the World: He causeth the inward Life (which is also many Times
not conveyed by the <i>outward Senses</i>) the more to abound, when his
Children assemble themselves diligently together to wait upon him;
<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>so that as <i>Iron sharpeneth Iron</i>, the Seeing of the Faces one of another,
when both are inwardly gathered unto the <i>Life</i>, giveth Occasion
for the <i>Life</i> secretly to rise, and pass from <i>Vessel</i> to <i>Vessel</i>. And as
many Candles lighted, and put in one Place, do greatly augment
the <i>Light</i>, and make it more to shine forth, so when many are gathered
together into the same <i>Life</i>, there is more of the Glory of God,
and his Power appears, to the Refreshment of each Individual; for
that he partakes not only of the <i>Light</i> and <i>Life</i> raised in himself, but
in all the rest. And therefore <i>Christ</i> hath particularly promised a
Blessing to such as assemble together in his <i>Name</i>, seeing he will be
<i>in the Midst of them</i>, Matt. xviii. 20. And the Author to the <i>Hebrews</i>
doth precisely prohibit the Neglect of this Duty, as being of very
dangerous and dreadful Consequence, in these Words; <i>Heb.</i> x. 24.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[Pg 332]</span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Assembling of ourselves is not to be neglected.</i></span><i>And let us consider one another, to provoke unto Love, and to good Works;
not forsaking the Assembling of ourselves together, as the Manner of some is;&mdash;For
if we sin wilfully, after that we have received the Knowledge of the
Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins.</i> And therefore the
Lord hath shewn that he hath a particular Respect to such as thus
assemble themselves together, because that thereby a publick Testimony
for him is upheld in the Earth, and his Name is thereby glorified;
and therefore such as are right in their <i>Spirits</i>, are naturally
drawn to keep the <i>Meetings</i> of <i>God’s People</i>, and never want a <i>spiritual
Influence</i> to lead them thereunto: And if any do it in a mere
customary Way, they will no Doubt suffer Condemnation for it.
Yet cannot the Appointing of Places and Times be accounted a <i>Ceremony</i>
and <i>Observation</i>, done in Man’s <i>Will</i>, in the <i>Worship</i> of <i>God</i>, seeing
none can say that it is an <i>Act</i> of <i>Worship</i>, but only a mere <i>Presenting</i>
of our <i>Persons</i> in order to it, as is abovesaid. Which that it was
practised by the <i>Primitive Church</i> and <i>Saints</i>, all our Adversaries do
acknowledge.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_109_109" id="Footnote_109_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> Prov. 27. 17.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span><i>Lastly</i>, Some object, <i>That this Manner of Worship in Silence is not to
be found in all the Scripture</i>:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; We make not Silence to be the sole Matter of our <i>Worship</i>;
since, as I have said above, there are many <i>Meetings</i>, which
are seldom altogether silent; some or other are still moved either to
<i>preach</i>, <i>pray</i>, or <i>praise</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>In waiting for the Spirit’s Guidance, Silence is supposed.</i></span>And so in this our <i>Meetings</i> cannot be but like the
<i>Meetings</i> of the <i>Primitive Churches</i> recorded in Scripture, since our <i>Adversaries</i>
confess that they did <i>preach</i> and <i>pray</i> by the <i>Spirit</i>. And then
what Absurdity is it to suppose, that at some Times the <i>Spirit</i> did
not move them to these outward <i>Acts</i>, and that then they were silent?
Since we may well conclude they did not speak until they were
moved; and so no Doubt had sometimes Silence. <i>Acts</i> ii. 1. before
the Spirit came upon them, it is said,&mdash;<i>They were all with one Accord in
one Place</i>; and then it is said, <i>The Spirit suddenly came upon them</i>; but
no Mention is made of any one speaking at that Time; and I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
willingly know what <i>Absurdity</i> our <i>Adversaries</i> can infer, should we
conclude they were a While silent?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inst.</span>But if it be urged, That a whole <i>silent Meeting cannot be found in
Scripture</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; Supposing such a Thing were not recorded, it will not
therefore follow that it is not lawful; since it naturally followeth from
other <i>Scripture Precepts</i>, as we have proved this doth.
<span class="sidenote">Silent Meetings<i> are proved from </i>Scripture<i> and </i>Reason.</span>For seeing the
<i>Scripture</i> commands to meet together, and when met, the Scripture
prohibits <i>Prayers</i> or <i>Preachings</i>, but as the Spirit moveth thereunto;
if People meet together, and the Spirit move not to such Acts, it
will necessarily follow that they must be silent. But further, there
might have been many such Things among the <i>Saints</i> of <i>old</i>, though
not recorded in <i>Scripture</i>; and yet we have enough in <i>Scripture</i>, signifying
that such Things were. For <i>Job</i> sat silent <i>seven Days with
his Friends together</i>; here was a long <i>silent Meeting</i>: See also <i>Ezra</i> ix. 4.
and <i>Ezekiel</i> xiv. 1. and xx. 1. Thus having shewn the Excellency
of this <i>Worship</i>, proving it from <i>Scripture</i> and <i>Reason</i>, and answered
the Objections which are commonly made against it, which, though
it may suffice to the Explanation and Proof of our <i>Proposition</i>, yet I
shall add something more particularly of <i>Preaching</i>, <i>Praying</i>, and
<i>Singing</i>, and so Proceed to the following <i>Proposition</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XVIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I.</span><i>Preaching</i>, as it is used both among <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>,
is for one Man to take some Place or Verse of Scripture, and
thereon <i>speak</i> for an Hour or two,
<span class="sidenote"><i>What Preaching is with the</i> Protestants <i>and</i> Papists.</span>what he hath studied and premeditated
in his Closet, and gathered together from his own Inventions,
or from the Writings and Observations of others; and then
having got it by Heart, (as a <i>School-boy</i> doth his <i>Lesson</i>) he brings it
forth, and repeats it before the People:
<span class="sidenote"><i>A studied Talk an Hour or two</i>.</span>And how much the more
fertile and strong a Man’s <i>Invention</i> is, and the more industrious and
laborious he is in collecting such <i>Observations</i>, and can utter them
with the <i>Excellency</i> of <i>Speech</i> and <i>human Eloquence</i>, so much the more
is he accounted an able and excellent Preacher.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>True </i>Preaching<i> by the </i>Spirit.</span>To this we oppose, that when the <i>Saints</i> are met together, and
every one gathered to the <i>Gift</i> and <i>Grace</i> of God in themselves, he
that ministereth, being actuated thereunto by the Arising of the
<i>Grace</i> in himself, ought to speak forth what the Spirit of God furnisheth
him with; not minding the <i>Eloquence</i> and <i>Wisdom</i> of <i>Words</i>,
but the <i>Demonstration</i> of the <i>Spirit</i> and of <i>Power</i>: And that either in
the Interpreting some Part of <i>Scripture</i>, in case the Spirit, which is
the good Remembrancer, lead him so to do, or otherwise <i>Words</i> of
<i>Exhortation</i>, <i>Advice</i>, <i>Reproof</i>, and <i>Instruction</i>, or the Sense of some
<i>spiritual Experiences</i>: All which will still be agreeable to the <i>Scripture</i>,
though perhaps not relative to, nor founded upon any particular
<i>Chapter</i> or <i>Verse</i>, as a <i>Text</i>. Now let us examine and consider which
of these two Sorts of Preaching is most agreeable to the <i>Precepts</i> of
<i>Christ</i> and his <i>Apostles</i>, and the <i>Primitive Church</i>, recorded in Scripture?
For, <i>First</i>, as to their <i>Preaching</i> upon a <i>Text</i>, if it were not merely
customary or premeditated, but done by the immediate Motion of
the <i>Spirit</i>, we should not blame it; but to do it as they do, there is
neither <i>Precept</i> nor <i>Practice</i>, that ever I could observe, in the <i>New
Testament</i>, as a Part of the <i>instituted Worship</i> thereof.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But they <i>allege</i>, <i>That Christ took the Book of </i>Isaiah,<i> and read out of
it, and spake therefrom</i>; <i>and that </i>Peter<i> preached from a Sentence of the
Prophet </i>Joel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote">1. Christ<i>’s and </i>Peter<i>’s Speaking was not by Premeditation.</i></span>
I <i>answer</i>, That <i>Christ</i> and <i>Peter</i> did it not but as immediately actuated
and moved thereunto by the Spirit of God, and that without
Premeditation, which I suppose our Adversaries will not deny; in
which Case we willingly approve of it. But what is this to their
customary conned Way, without either waiting for or expecting the
Movings or Leadings of the Spirit? Moreover, that neither <i>Christ</i>
nor <i>Peter</i> did it as a settled Custom or Form, to be constantly practised
by all the Ministers of the Church, appears, in that most of all
the Sermons recorded of <i>Christ</i> and his <i>Apostles</i> in Scripture were
without this, as appears from <i>Christ</i>’s Sermon upon the Mount,
<i>Matt.</i> v. 1. &amp;c. <i>Mark</i> iv. 1. <i>&amp;c.</i> and <i>Paul</i>’s Preaching to the <i>Athenians</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
and to the <i>Jews</i>, &amp;c. As then it appears that this Method of Preaching
is not grounded upon any Scripture Precept, so the Nature of
it is contrary to the Preaching of Christ under the <i>New Covenant</i>, as
expressed and recommended in Scripture; for Christ, in sending
forth his Disciples, expresly mentioneth, that they are not to speak
<i>of</i> or <i>from</i> themselves, or to forecast beforehand, but that which the
<i>Spirit in the same Hour shall teach them</i>, as is particularly mentioned in
the three Evangelists, <i>Matt.</i> x. 20. <i>Mark</i> xiii. 11. <i>Luke</i> xii. 12. Now
if <i>Christ</i> gave this Order to his Disciples before he departed from
them, as that which they were to practise during his Abode outwardly
with them, much more were they to do it after his Departure,
since then they were more especially to receive the Spirit, <i>to
lead them in all Things</i>, and to <i>bring all Things to their Remembrance</i>,
John xiv. 26. And if they were to do so when they appeared before
the Magistrates and Princes of the Earth, much more in the
Worship of God, when they stand specially before him; seeing, as
is above shewn, his Worship is to be performed in Spirit; and
therefore after their Receiving of the <i>Holy Ghost</i> it is said, <i>Acts</i> ii. 4.
<i>They spake as the Spirit gave them Utterance</i>, not what they had studied
and gathered from Books in their Closets in a premeditated Way.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Franciscus Lambertus<i>’s Testimony against the </i>Priests<i> studied Inventions and Figments.</i></span><i>Franciscus Lambertus</i>, before cited, speaketh well and sheweth their
Hypocrisy, <i>Tract.</i> 5. of <i>Prophecy</i>, Chap. 3. saying, “Where are they
now, that glory in their Inventions, who say, A fine Invention!
A fine Invention! This they call Invention, which themselves
have made up; but what have the Faithful to do with such Kind
of Inventions? It is not Figments, nor yet Inventions, that we
will have, but Things that are solid, invincible, eternal, and
heavenly; not which Men have invented, but which God hath
revealed: For if we believe the Scriptures, our Invention profiteth
nothing, but to provoke God to our Ruin.” And afterwards,
“Beware, (saith he) that thou determine not precisely to
speak what before thou hast meditated, whatsoever it be; for
though it be lawful to determine the Text which thou art to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>pound,
yet not at all the Interpretation; lest if thou so dost, thou
take from the Holy Spirit that which is his, to wit, to direct thy
Speech, that thou mayest prophesy in the Name of the Lord, void
of all Learning, Meditation, and Experience, and as if thou hadst
studied nothing at all, committing thy Heart, thy Tongue, and
thyself wholly unto his Spirit, and trusting nothing to thy former
Studying or Meditation; but saying with thyself, in great Confidence
of the divine Promise, <i>The Lord will give a Word with much
Power unto those that preach the Gospel</i>. But above all Things be
careful thou follow not the Manner of <i>Hypocrites</i>, who have written
almost Word for Word what they are to say, as if they were
to repeat some Verses upon a Theatre, having learned all their
Preaching as they do that act <i>Tragedies</i>. And afterwards, when
they are in the Place of Prophesying, pray the Lord to direct their
Tongue; but in the mean Time, shutting up the Way of the
Holy Spirit, they determine to say nothing but what they have
written. O unhappy Kind of <i>Prophets</i>, yea, and truly cursed,
which depend not upon God’s Spirit, but upon their own
Writings or Meditation! Why prayest thou to the Lord, thou
false Prophet, to give thee his Holy Spirit, by which thou mayest
speak Things profitable, and yet thou repellest the Spirit? Why
preferrest thou thy Meditation or Study to the Spirit of God?
Otherwise why committest thou not thyself to the Spirit?”</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>2. The Words Man’s Wisdom brings beget not Faith.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This Manner of Preaching as used by them
(considering that they also affirm, <i>That it may be and often is performed
by Men who are wicked, or void of true Grace</i>) cannot only not edify
the Church, beget or nourish true Faith, but is destructive to it,
being directly contrary to the Nature of the <i>Christian</i> and <i>Apostolick
Ministry</i> mentioned in the Scriptures: For the <i>Apostle preached the
Gospel not in the Wisdom of Words, lest the Cross of Christ should be of none
Effect</i>, 1 Cor. i. 17. But this Preaching, not being done by the
Actings and Moving of God’s Spirit, but by Man’s Invention and
Eloquence, in his own Will, and through his natural and acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span>
Parts and Learning, is in the Wisdom of Words, and therefore the
<i>Cross of Christ</i> is thereby made of none Effect. The Apostles <i>Speech</i>
and <i>Preaching</i> was not <i>with enticing Words of Man’s Wisdom, but in Demonstration
of the Spirit and of Power</i>, that the Faith of their Hearers
<i>should not stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God</i>, 1 Cor. ii.
3, 4, 5. But this Preaching having nothing of the Spirit and Power
in it, both the Preachers and Hearers confessing they wait for no
such Thing, nor yet are oftentimes sensible of it, must needs stand
in the enticing Words of Man’s Wisdom, since it is by the mere
Wisdom of Man it is sought after, and the mere Strength of Man’s
Eloquence and enticing Words it is uttered; and therefore no Wonder
if the Faith of such as hear and depend upon such Preachers and
Preachings stand in the Wisdom of Men, and not in the Power of God.
The Apostles declared, That they <i>spake not in the Words which Man’s
Wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth</i>, 1 Cor. ii. 13. But
these Preachers confess that they are Strangers to the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, his
Motions and Operations, neither do they wait to feel them, and
therefore they speak in the Words which their own natural Wisdom
and Learning teach them, mixing them in, and adding them
to, such Words as they steal out of the Scripture and other Books,
and therefore speak not what the <i>Holy Ghost</i> teacheth.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">3. <i>The Church’s Method was to speak by </i>Revelation.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, This is contrary to the Method and Order of the <i>Primitive
Church</i> mentioned by the Apostle, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xiv. 30, <i>&amp;c.</i> where in
<i>Preaching</i> every one is to wait for his <i>Revelation</i>, and to give Place
one unto another, according as Things are revealed; but here
there is no waiting for a <i>Revelation</i>, but the Preacher must speak,
and not that which is revealed unto him, but what he hath prepared
and premeditated <span class="correction" title="In the original book: before-hand">beforehand</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">4. <i>The Spirit is shut out by Priests from being the Teacher.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, By this Kind of Preaching the Spirit of God, which should
be the chief Instructor and Teacher of God’s People, and whose Influence
is that only which makes all Preaching effectual and beneficial
for the edifying of Souls, is shut out, and Man’s natural Wisdom,
Learning, and Parts set up and exalted; which no Doubt is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span>
a great and chief Reason why the Preaching among the Generality of
<i>Christians</i> is so unfruitful and unsuccessful. Yea, according to this
Doctrine, the Devil may preach, and ought to be heard also, seeing
he both knows the Truth, and hath as much Eloquence as any.
But what avails Excellency of Speech, if the Demonstration and
Power of the Spirit be wanting, which toucheth the Conscience?
We see that when the Devil confessed to the Truth, yet Christ would
have none of his Testimony. And as these pregnant Testimonies of
the Scripture do prove this Part of Preaching to be contrary to the
Doctrine of Christ, so do they also prove <i>that of ours</i> before affirmed
to be conformable thereunto.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if any object after this Manner, <i>Have not many been
benefited, yea, and both converted and edified by the Ministry of such as have
premeditated their Preaching? Yea, and hath not the Spirit often concurred
by its divine Influence with Preachings thus premeditated, so as they have
been powerfully borne in upon the Souls of the Hearers to their Advantage?</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, Though that be granted, which I shall not deny, it
will not infer that the Thing was good in itself, more than because
Paul was met with by Christ to the converting of his Soul riding
to <i>Damascus</i> to persecute the Saints, that he did well in so doing.
<span class="sidenote">Paul<i> persecuting was converted, is therefore persecuting good?</i></span>Neither particular Actions, nor yet whole Congregations, as we
above observed, are to be measured by the Acts of God’s Condescension
in Times of Ignorance. But besides, it hath oftentimes
fallen out, that God, having a Regard to the Simplicity and Integrity
either of the Preacher or Hearers, hath fallen in upon the
Heart of a Preacher by his Power and holy Influence, and thereby
hath led him to speak Things that were not in his premeditated
Discourse, and which perhaps he never thought on before; and
those passing Ejaculations and unpremeditated but living Exhortations,
have proved more beneficial and refreshing both to Preacher
and Hearers than all their premeditated Sermons. But all that
will not allow them to continue in these Things which in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>selves
are not approved, but contrary to the Practice of the Apostles,
when God is raising up a People to serve him, according to the
<i>primitive Purity</i> and <i>Spirituality</i>; yea, such Acts of <i>God’s Condescension</i>,
in Times of Darkness and Ignorance, should engage all more and
more to follow him, according as he reveals his most <i>perfect</i> and
<i>spiritual Way</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">II.</span>Having hitherto spoken of <i>Preaching</i>, now it is fit to
speak of <i>Praying</i>, concerning which the like Controversy ariseth.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of</i> Prayer, <i>how the outward is distinguished from the inward</i>.</span>Our Adversaries, whose <i>Religion</i> is all for the most Part <i>Outside</i>, and
such whose Acts are the mere Product of Man’s natural Will and
Abilities, as they can preach, so can they pray when they please,
and therefore have their set particular Prayers. I meddle not with
the Controversies among themselves concerning this, some of them
being for <i>set Prayers</i>, as a <i>Liturgy</i>, others for such as are conceived
<i>extempore</i>; It suffices me that all of them agree in this, That the
Motions and Influence of the Spirit of God are not necessary to be
previous thereunto;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Priests set Times to preach and pray, deny the Spirit.</i></span>and therefore they have <i>set Times</i> in their publick
Worship, as before and after Preaching, and in their private
Devotion, as Morning and Evening, and before and after Meat,
and other such Occasions, at which they precisely set about the
performing of their Prayers, by speaking Words to God, whether
they feel any Motion or Influence of the Spirit or not; so that some
of the chiefest have confessed that they have thus prayed without
the Motions or Assistance of the Spirit, acknowledging that they
sinned in so doing; yet they said they looked upon it as their Duty
to do so, though to pray without the Spirit be Sin. We freely
confess that <i>Prayer</i> is both very profitable, and a necessary Duty
commanded, and fit to be practised frequently by all <i>Christians</i>; but
as we can do nothing without Christ, so neither can we pray without
the Concurrence and Assistance of his Spirit. But that the
<i>State</i> of the <i>Controversy</i> may be the better understood, let it be considered,
<i>First</i>, that <i>Prayer</i> is <span class="correction" title="In the original book: two-fold">twofold</span>, <i>inward</i> and <i>outward</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What inward Prayer is.</i></span><i>Inward
Prayer</i> is that <i>secret Turning of the Mind towards God</i>, whereby, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span>
secretly touched and awakened by the <i>Light of Christ</i> in the Conscience,
and so bowed down under the Sense of its Iniquities, Unworthiness,
and Misery, it looks up to God, and joining with the
secret Shinings of the <i>Seed of God</i>, it breathes towards him, and is
constantly breathing forth some secret Desires and Aspirations towards
him. It is in this Sense that we are so frequently in Scripture
commanded to <i>pray continually</i>, Luke xviii. 1. 1 Thess. v. 17.
Ephes. vi. 18. Luke xxi. 36. which cannot be understood of <i>outward
Prayer</i>, because it were impossible that Men should be always upon
their Knees, expressing <i>Words</i> of <i>Prayer</i>; and this would hinder them
from the Exercise of those <i>Duties</i> no less positively commanded.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What outward Prayer is.</i></span><i>Outward Prayer</i> is, when as the Spirit, being thus in the Exercise of
inward Retirement, and feeling the Breathing of the Spirit of God
to arise powerfully in the Soul, receives Strength and Liberty by a
superadded Motion and Influence of the <i>Spirit</i> to bring forth either
audible <i>Sight</i>, <i>Groans</i>, or <i>Words</i>, and that either in publick Assemblies,
or in private, or at Meat, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Inward Prayer necessary at all Times.</i></span>As then <i>inward Prayer is necessary at all Times</i>, so, so long as the Day of
every Man’s <i>Visitation</i> lasteth, he never wants some Influence, less or
more, for the Practice of it; because he no sooner retires his Mind,
and considers himself in God’s Presence, but he finds himself in the
Practice of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Outward Prayer doth require a superadded Influence.</i></span>The <i>outward Exercise of Prayer</i>, as needing a greater and superadded
Influence and Motion of the Spirit, as it cannot be continually
practised, so neither can it be so readily, so as to be effectually
performed, until his Mind be some Time acquainted with the <i>Inward</i>;
therefore such as are diligent and watchful in their Minds,
and much retired in the Exercise of this <i>inward Prayer</i>, are more
capable to be frequent in the Use of the <i>Outward</i>, because that this
holy Influence doth more constantly attend them, and they being
better acquainted with, and accustomed to, the Motions of <i>God’s
Spirit</i>, can easily perceive and discern them. And indeed, as such
who are most diligent have a near Access to God, and he taketh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span>
most Delight to draw them by his <i>Spirit</i> to approach and call upon
him, so when many are gathered together in this <i>watchful Mind</i>, God
doth frequently pour forth the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>Prayer</i> among them and stir
them thereunto, to the edifying and building up of one another in
<i>Love</i>. But because this <i>outward Prayer</i> depends upon the <i>inward</i>, as
that which must follow it, and cannot be acceptably performed but
as attended with a superadded Influence and Motion of the <i>Spirit</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>We cannot fix set Times to speak and pray</i>.</span>therefore we cannot prefix set Times to <i>pray outwardly</i>, so as to lay
a Necessity to speak Words at such and such Times, whether we
feel this heavenly Influence and Assistance or no; for that we judge
were a Tempting of God, and a Coming before him without due
<i>Preparation</i>. We think it fit for us to present ourselves before him
by this <i>inward Retirement</i> of the <i>Mind</i>, and so to proceed further,
as his Spirit shall help us and draw us thereunto; and we find that
the Lord accepts of this, yea, and seeth meet sometimes to exercise
us in this silent Place for the Trial of our <i>Patience</i>, without allowing
us to speak further, that he may teach us not to rely upon outward
<i>Performances</i>, or satisfy ourselves, as too many do, with the
Saying of our <i>Prayers</i>; and that our Dependence upon him may be
the more firm and constant, to wait for the Holding out of his <i>Sceptre</i>,
and for his Allowance to draw near unto him, with greater
Freedom and Enlargement of <i>Spirit</i> upon our <i>Hearts</i> towards him.
Yet nevertheless we do not deny but sometimes God, upon particular
Occasions, very suddenly, yea, upon the very first turning in
of the <i>Mind</i>, may give Power and Liberty to bring forth Words or
Acts of <i>outward Prayer</i>, so as the Soul can scarce discern any previous
Motion, but the Influence and Bringing forth thereof may be as it
were <i>simul &amp; semel</i>: Nevertheless that Saying of <i>Bernard</i> is true,
that <i>all Prayer is lukewarm, which hath not an Inspiration preceding it</i>.
Though we affirm that none ought to go about <i>Prayer</i> without this
Motion, yet we do not deny but such <i>sin</i> as neglect <i>Prayer</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Such sin as are neglecting Prayer.</i></span>but
their <i>Sin</i> is in that they come not to that Place where they may feel
that which would lead them thereunto. And therefore we question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span>
not but many, through Neglect of this <i>inward Watchfulness</i> and <i>Retiredness</i>
of <i>Mind</i>, miss many precious Opportunities to <i>pray</i>, and
thereby are guilty in the Sight of God; yet would they <i>sin</i> if they
should set about the Act until they first felt the Influence.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A forward and a careless Servant answers not his Duty</i>.</span>For as
he grosly offends his <i>Master</i> that lieth in his Bed and sleeps, and
neglects to do his <i>Master’s Business</i>; yet if such a one should suddenly
get up, without putting on his Clothes, or taking along with
him those necessary <i>Tools</i> and <i>Instruments</i>, without which he could
not possibly work, and should forwardly fall a doing to no Purpose,
he would be so far thereby from repairing his former <i>Fault</i>, that he
would justly incur a new Censure: And as one that is careless and
otherways busied may miss to hear one speaking unto him, or even
not hear the Bell of a Clock, though striking hard-by him, so may
many, through Negligence, miss to hear God oftentimes calling
upon them, and giving them Access to pray unto him; yet will
not that allow them, without his Liberty, in their own Wills to fall
to Work.</p>

<p>And <i>Lastly</i>, Though this be the only true and proper Method of
Prayer, as that which is alone acceptable to God,
<span class="sidenote"><i>In Times of Darkness God did often hear their Prayers.</i></span>yet shall we not
deny but he oftentimes answered the <i>Prayers</i> and concurred with
the <i>Desires</i> of some, especially in Times of <i>Darkness</i>, who have greatly
erred herein; so that some that have sat down in <i>formal Prayer</i>,
though far wrong in the Matter as well as Manner, without the Assistance
or Influence of <i>God’s Spirit</i>, yet have found him to take Occasion
therethrough to break in upon their Souls, and wonderfully
tender and refresh them; yet as in <i>Preaching</i>, and elsewhere hath
afore been observed, that will not prove any such <i>Practices</i>, or be a
just Let to hinder any from coming to <i>practise</i> that <i>pure</i>, <i>spiritual</i>, and
<i>acceptable Prayer</i>, which God is again restoring and <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: leading People">leading his People</span>
into, out of all <i>Superstitions</i> and mere <i>empty Formalities</i>. The State of
the <i>Controversy</i>, and our <i>Sense</i> thereof, being thus clearly stated, will
both obviate many <i>Objections</i>, and make the Answer to others more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
brief and easy.
<span class="sidenote">First,<i> Spiritual Prayer proved from </i>Scripture.</span>I shall first prove this <i>spiritual Prayer</i> by some short
Considerations from <i>Scripture</i>, and then answer the Objections of
our Opposers, which will also serve to refute their Method and
Manner thereof.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I. <i>God’s Spirit must be felt to move the Mind to Prayer</i>.</span>
And <i>First</i>, That there is a Necessity of this <i>inward Retirement</i>
of the <i>Mind</i> as previous to <i>Prayer</i>, that the <i>Spirit</i> may be felt to
draw thereunto, appears, for that in most of those Places where
<i>Prayer</i> is commanded, <i>Watching</i> is prefixed thereunto, as necessary
to go before, as <i>Matt.</i> xxiv. 42. <i>Mark</i> xiii. 33. and xiv. 38. <i>Luke</i>
xxi. 36. from which it is evident that this <i>Watching</i> was to go before
Prayer. Now to what End is this <i>Watching</i>, or what is it,
but a Waiting to feel <i>God’s Spirit</i> to draw unto <i>Prayer</i>, that so it may
be done acceptably? For since we are to <a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a><i>pray always in the Spirit</i>, and
cannot pray of ourselves without it acceptably, this Watching must
be for this End recommended to us, as preceding <i>Prayer</i>, that we
may watch and wait for the seasonable Time to <i>pray</i>, which is when
the Spirit moves thereunto.</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> Ephes. 6. 18.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">II. <i>We know not how to </i>pray<i> but as the Spirit helps.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, This Necessity of the Spirit’s Moving and Concurrence
appears abundantly from that of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, Rom. viii. 26, 27.
<i>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities: For we know not what we
should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh Intercession for us with
Groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the Hearts knoweth
what is the Mind of the Spirit, because he maketh Intercession for the
Saints according to the Will of God.</i> Which <i>first</i> holds forth the Incapacity
of Men as of themselves to pray or call upon God in their
own Wills, even such as have received the <i>Faith</i> of <i>Christ</i>, and are
in Measure sanctified by it, as was the Church of <i>Rome</i>, to whom
the Apostle then wrote. <i>Secondly</i>, It holds forth that which can only
help and assist Men to pray, to wit, the Spirit, as that without
which they cannot do it acceptably to God, nor beneficially to
their own Souls. <i>Thirdly</i>, The Manner and Way of the Spirit’s Intercession,
<i>with Sighs and Groans which are unutterable</i>. And <i>Fourthly</i>,
That God receiveth graciously the Prayers of such as are presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
and offered unto himself by the Spirit, <i>knowing it to be according to his
Will</i>. Now it cannot be conceived but this Order of Prayer thus
asserted by the Apostle is most consistent with those other Testimonies
of Scripture, commending and recommending to us the Use of
Prayer. From which I thus argue,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span><i>If any Man know not how to pray, </i>neither<i> can do it without the Help of
the Spirit, then it is to no Purpose for him, but altogether unprofitable</i>, to
pray without it:</p>

<p><i>But the </i>First<i> is true: Therefore also the </i>Last.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">III. <i>Pray always in the Spirit, and Watching thereunto.</i></span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, This Necessity of the Spirit to true Prayer appears from
<i>Ephes.</i> vi. 18. and <i>Jude</i> 20. where the Apostle commands <i>to pray always
in the Spirit, and Watching thereunto</i>; which is as much as if he
had said, that we were never to pray without the Spirit, or Watching
thereunto. And <i>Jude</i> sheweth that such Prayers as are <i>in the
Holy Ghost</i> only, tend to the <i>Building up of ourselves in our most holy Faith</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">IV. <i>Man cannot call </i>Christ Lord<i> but by the Holy Ghost.</i></span>
<i>Fourthly</i>, The Apostle <i>Paul</i> saith expresly, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xii. 3. <i>That no
Man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost</i>: If then Jesus
cannot be thus rightly named but by the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, far less can he
be acceptably called upon. Hence the same Apostle declares, 1 <i>Cor.</i>
xiv. 15. that he <i>will pray with the Spirit</i>, &amp;c. A clear Evidence that
it was none of his Method to pray without it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">V. <i>God will not hear the Prayers of the Wicked.</i></span>
But <i>Fifthly</i>, All <i>Prayer</i> without the Spirit is <i>Abomination</i>, such as
are the <i>Prayers of the Wicked</i>, Prov. xxviii. 9. And the <i>Confidence</i> that
the Saints have that <i>God will hear them</i> is, if they <i>ask any Thing according
to his Will</i>, 1 John v. 14. So if the Prayer be not according
to his Will, there is no Ground of Confidence that he will hear.
Now our Adversaries will acknowledge that Prayers without the
Spirit are not according to the Will of God, and therefore such as
pray without it have no Ground to expect an Answer: For indeed
to bid a Man <i>pray</i> without the <i>Spirit</i> is all one as to bid one <i>see</i> without
<i>Eyes</i>, <i>work</i> without <i>Hands</i>, or <i>go</i> without <i>Feet</i>. And to desire a
Man to fall to <i>Prayer</i> ere the Spirit in some Measure less or more
move him thereunto, is to desire a Man to see before he opens his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
Eyes, or to walk before he rise up, or to work with his Hands before
he moves them.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">VI. <i>All Sacrifice is Sin, not offered by the Spirit.</i></span>
But <i>Lastly</i>, From this false Opinion of Praying without
the Spirit, and not judging it necessary to be waited for, as that
which may be felt to move us thereunto, hath proceeded all the Superstition
and Idolatry that is among those called <i>Christians</i>, and
those many Abominations wherewith the Lord is <i>provoked</i>, and his
<i>Spirit grieved</i>; so that many deceive themselves now, as the <i>Jews</i>
did of old, thinking it sufficient if they pay their daily Sacrifices,
and offer their customary Oblations; from thence thinking all is
well, and creating a false Peace to themselves, as the <i>Whore</i> in the
<i>Proverbs</i>, because they have offered up their <i>Sacrifices</i> of Morning and
Evening Prayers. And therefore it is manifest that their constant
Use of these Things doth not a Whit influence their Lives and Conversations,
but they remain for the most Part as bad as ever. Yea,
it is frequent both among <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, for them to leap as
it were out of their vain, light, and profane Conversations at their
<i>set Hours</i> and <i>Seasons</i>, and fall to their customary Devotion; and
then, when it is scarce finished, and the Words to God scarce out,
the former profane Talk comes after it; so that the same wicked
profane Spirit of this World actuates them in both. If there be
any such Thing as <i>vain Oblations</i>, or <i>Prayers that are Abomination</i>, which
God heareth not (as is certain there are, and the Scripture testifies,
<i>Isa.</i> lxvi. 3. <i>Jer.</i> xiv. 12.) certainly such <i>Prayers</i> as are acted in
Man’s Will, and by his own Strength, without God’s Spirit, must
be of that Number.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXIV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Concerning </i>Joining in Prayer<i> with others.</i></span>Let this suffice for Proof. I shall now proceed to
answer their Objections, when I have said something concerning
<i>joining in Prayer with others</i>. Those that pray together with one Accord
use not only to concur in their Spirits, but also in the Gesture
of their Body; which we also willingly approve of. It becometh
those who approach before God to <i>pray</i>, that they do it with
<i>bowed Knees</i>, and with their <i>Heads uncovered</i>, which is our Practice.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>But here ariseth a Controversy, <i>Whether it be lawful to join with
others by those external Signs of Reverence, albeit not in Heart, who pray
formally, not waiting for the Motion of the Spirit, nor judging it necessary</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>We answer, Not at all; and for our Testimony in this Thing we
have suffered not a little.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Reason why we cannot </i>join in Prayer.</span>For when it hath fallen out, that either
accidentally, or to witness against their Worship, we have been
present during the same, and have not found it lawful for us to
<i>bow</i> with them thereunto, they have often persecuted us, not only
with Reproaches, but also with Strokes and cruel Beatings. For
this Cause they used to accuse us of Pride, Profanity, and Madness,
as if we had no Respect or Reverence to the <i>Worship of God</i>, and as
if we judged none could pray, or were heard of God, but ourselves.
Unto all which, and many more Reproaches of this Kind, we
answer briefly and modestly, That it sufficeth us that we are found
so doing, neither through Pride, nor Madness, nor Profanity, but
merely lest we should hurt our <i>Consciences</i>; the Reason of which is
plain and evident: For since our <i>Principle</i> and <i>Doctrine</i> oblige us to
believe that the <i>Prayers</i> of those who themselves confess they are <i>not
actuated by the Spirit</i> are <i>Abominations</i>, how can we with a safe Conscience
join with them?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>If they urge, <i>That this is the Height of Uncharitableness and Arrogancy,
as if we judged ourselves always to pray by the Spirit’s Motion, but they never;
as if we were never deceived by praying without the Motions of the Spirit, and
that they were never actuated by it, seeing albeit they judge not the Motion of
the Spirit always necessary, they confess nevertheless that it is very profitable
and comfortable, and they feel it often influencing them; which that it sometimes
falls out we cannot deny</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>To all which I answer distinctly, If it were their known and
avowed <i>Doctrine</i> not to pray without the Motion of the Spirit, and
that, seriously holding thereunto, they did not bind themselves to
pray at certain <i>prescribed Times</i> precisely, at which Times they determine
to pray, though without the Spirit, then indeed we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span>
be accused of Uncharitableness and Pride, if we never joined with
them; and if they so taught and practised, I doubt not but it would
be lawful for us so to do, unless there should appear some manifest
and evident Hypocrisy and Delusion.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Shall we confirm the </i>Hypocrites<i> when praying?</i></span>But seeing they confess that
they <i>pray without the Spirit</i>, and seeing God hath persuaded us that
such Prayers are <i>abominable</i>, how can we with a safe Conscience join
with an <i>Abomination</i>? That God sometimes condescends to them,
we do not deny; although now, when the <i>spiritual Worship</i> is openly
proclaimed, and all are invited unto it, the Case is otherwise than
in those old Times of Apostasy and Darkness; and therefore, albeit
any should begin to pray in our Presence, not expecting the Motion
of the Spirit; yet if it manifestly appear that God in Condescension
did concur with such a one, then according to God’s Will we should
not refuse to join also; but this is rare, lest thence they should be
confirmed in their false Principle. And although this seems hard
in our Profession, nevertheless it is so confirmed by the Authority
both of Scripture and right Reason, that many convinced thereof
have embraced this Part before other <i>Truths</i>, which were easier, and,
as they seemed to some, clearer. Among whom is memorable of
late Years <i>Alexander Skein</i>, a Magistrate of the City of <i>Aberdeen</i>, a
Man very modest, and very averse from giving Offence to others,
who nevertheless being overcome by the Power of Truth in this
Matter, behoved for this Cause to separate himself from the publick
Assemblies and Prayers, and join himself unto us; who also gave
the Reason of his Change, and likewise succinctly, but yet substantially,
comprehended this Controversy concerning <i>Worship</i> in
some short Questions, which he offered to the publick Preachers of
the <i>City</i>, and which I think meet to insert in this Place.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sidenote"><i>Some Questions of</i> A. Skein <i>proposed to the Preachers in</i> Aberdeen.</span>1. <i>Whether or not should an Act of God’s Worship be gone about without
the Motions, Leadings, and Actings of the Holy Spirit?</i></p>

<p>2. <i>If the Motions of the Spirit be necessary to every particular Duty, whether
should he be waited upon, that all our Acts and Words may be according
as he gives Utterance and Assistance?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>3. <i>Whether every one that bears the Name of a </i>Christian<i>, or professes
to be a </i>Protestant<i>, hath such an uninterrupted Measure thereof, that he may,
without waiting, go immediately about the Duty?</i></p>

<p>4. <i>If there be an Indisposition and Unfitness at some Times for such Exercises,
at least as to the spiritual and lively Performance thereof, whether
ought they to be performed in that Case, and at that Time?</i></p>

<p>5. <i>If any Duty be gone about, under Pretence that it is in Obedience to
the external Command, without the spiritual Life and Motion necessary, whether
such a Duty thus performed can in Faith be expected to be accepted of God,
and not rather reckoned as a <a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>Bringing of strange Fire before the Lord, seeing
it is performed at best by the Strength of natural and acquired Parts, and
not by the Strength and Assistance of the Holy Ghost, which was typified by the
Fire that came down from Heaven, which alone behoved to consume the Sacrifice,
and no other?</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> Lev. 16. 1.</p></div>

<p>6. <i>Whether Duties gone about in the mere Strength of natural and acquired
Parts, whether in Publick or Private, be not as really, upon the
Matter, an Image of Man’s Invention as the </i>Popish<i> Worship, though not
so gross in the outward Appearance? And therefore whether it be not as real
Superstition to countenance any Worship of that Nature, as it is to countenance
</i>Popish<i> Worship, though there be a Difference in the Degree?</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Whether it be a Ground of Offence or just Scandal to countenance the
Worship of those whose professed Principle it is neither to speak for Edification,
nor to pray, but as the Holy Ghost shall be pleased to assist them in some Measure
less or more; without which they rather choose to be silent, than to
speak without this Influence?</i></p>

<p class="p2">Unto these they answered but very coldly and faintly, whose
Answers likewise long ago he refuted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>We must not lose our Witnessing for God.</i></span>Seeing then God hath called us to his spiritual Worship, and to
testify against the human and voluntary Worships of the Apostasy,
if we did not this Way stand immoveable to the <i>Truth</i> revealed, but
should join with them, both our Testimony for God would be
weakened and lost, and it would be impossible steadily to propagate
this Worship in the World, whose Progress we dare neither retard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
nor hinder by any Act of ours; though therefore we shall lose not
only worldly Honour, but even our Lives. And truly many <i>Protestants</i>,
through their Unsteadiness in this Thing, for politic Ends
complying with the <i>Popish Abominations</i>, have greatly scandalized
their Profession, and hurt the Reformation;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Elector of</i> Saxony’<i>s Scandal given to</i> Protestants.</span>as appeared in the Example
of the <i>Elector</i> of <i>Saxony</i>; who, in the Convention at <i>Augsburgh</i>,
in the Year 1530, being commanded by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> the
Fifth to be present at the <i>Mass</i>, that he might carry the Sword before
him, according to his Place; which when he justly scrupled to
perform, his Preachers taking more Care for their Prince’s Honour
than for his Conscience, persuaded him that it was lawful to do
it against his Conscience. Which was both a very bad Example,
and great Scandal to the Reformation, and displeased many; as the
Author of the <i>History</i> of the <i>Council</i> of <i>Trent</i>, in his first Book, well
observes.
<span class="sidenote">Secondly,<i> Objections against spiritual Prayer </i>answered.</span>But now I hasten to the Objections of our Adversaries
against this Method of Praying.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span><i>First</i>, They object, <i>That if such particular Influences were
needful to outward Acts of Worship, then they should also be needful to inward
Acts; to wit, Desire and Love to God. But this is absurd; therefore
also that from whence it follows.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; That which was said in the <i>State</i> of the <i>Controversy</i>
cleareth this; because, as to those general Duties, there never wants
an Influence, so long as the Day of a Man’s Visitation lasteth;
during which Time <i>God is always near</i> to him, and <i>wrestling</i> with him
by his Spirit, to turn him to himself; so that if he do but stand
still, and cease from his evil Thoughts, the Lord is near to help
him, <i>&amp;c.</i> But as to the outward Acts of Prayer, they need a more
special Motion and Influence, as hath been proved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object, <i>That it might be also alleged, that Men ought
not to do moral Duties, as Children to honour their Parents, Men to do right
to their Neighbours, except the Spirit move them to it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; There is a great Difference between these general Duties
betwixt Man and Man, and the particular express Acts of Wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span>ship
towards God: The one is merely spiritual, and commanded
by God to be performed by his Spirit; the other answer their End,
as to them whom they are immediately directed to and concern,
though done from a mere natural Principle of Self-love; even as
<i>Beasts</i> have natural Affections one to another, and therefore may
be thus performed. Though I shall not deny, but that they are not
Works accepted of God, or beneficial to the Soul, but as they are
done in the Fear of God, and in his Blessing, in which his Children
do all Things, and therefore are accepted and blessed in whatsoever
they do.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object, <i>That if a wicked Man ought not to pray without
a Motion of the Spirit, because his Prayer would be sinful; neither ought he to
plow by the same Reason, because the <a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></i>Plowing of the Wicked<i>, as well as
his Praying, </i>is Sin.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> Prov. 21. 4.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This Objection is of the same Nature with the former, and therefore
may be answered the same Way;
<span class="sidenote"><i>How Acts of Nature differ from the Spirit’s</i>.</span>seeing there is a great Difference
betwixt natural Acts, such as <i>Eating</i>, <i>Drinking</i>, <i>Sleeping</i>, and
<i>seeking Sustenance for the Body</i> (which Things Man hath common with
Beasts) and spiritual Acts. And it doth not follow, because Man
ought not to go about <i>spiritual Acts</i> without the Spirit, that therefore
he may not go about <i>natural Acts</i> without it. The <i>Analogy</i> holds better
thus, and that for the Proof of our Affirmation, That as Man
for the going about natural Acts needs his natural Spirit; so to perform
spiritual Acts he needs the Spirit of God. That the <i>natural
Acts</i> of the Wicked and Unregenerate are <i>sinful</i>, is not denied; though
not as in themselves, but in so far as Man in that State is in all
Things reprobated in the Sight of God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They object, <i>That wicked Men may, according to this Doctrine,
forbear to pray for Years together, alleging, They want a Motion to it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; The false Pretences of wicked Men do nothing invalidate
the Truth of this Doctrine; for at that Rate there is no Doctrine
of Christ, which Men might not set aside. That <i>they ought not
to pray without the Spirit</i>, is granted; but then they ought to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span>
that Place of <i>Watching</i>, where they may be capable to feel the Spirit’s
Motion.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That wicked Men neglect the Motions of the Spirit to pray.</i></span>They <i>sin</i> indeed in not <i>Praying</i>; but the Cause of this <i>Sin</i>
is their not <i>Watching</i>: So their Neglect proceeds not from this Doctrine,
but from their Disobedience to it; seeing if they did pray
without this, it would be a double Sin, and no Fulfilling of the
Command to <i>pray</i>: Nor yet would their <i>Prayer</i>, without this Spirit,
be useful unto them. And this our Adversaries are forced to acknowledge
in another Case: For they say, <i>It is a Duty incumbent on
Christians to frequent the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper</i>, as they call it;
yet they say, <i>No Man ought to take it unworthily</i>: Yea, they plead,
That such as find themselves unprepared, must abstain; and therefore
do usually <i>excommunicate</i> them from the Table. Now, though
according to them it be necessary to partake of this Sacrament; yet
it is also necessary that those that do it, do first examine themselves,
lest they eat and drink their own Condemnation: And though they
reckon it <i>sinful</i> for them to forbear, yet they account it more <i>sinful</i>
for them to do it without this Examination.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 5.</span><i>Fifthly</i>, They object, <i>Acts</i> viii. 22. <i>where</i> Peter <i>commanded</i> Simon
Magus, <i>that wicked Sorcerer, to pray</i>; from thence inferring, <i>That
wicked Men may and ought to pray</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer; That in the citing of this Place, as I have often observed,
they omit the first and chief Part of the Verse, which is
thus, <i>Acts</i> viii. Ver. 22.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Sorcerer<i> may pray, but not without </i>Repentance.</span><i>Repent therefore of this thy Wickedness, and pray
God, if perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee</i>: So here
he bids him first <i>Repent</i>. Now the least Measure of true Repentance
cannot be without somewhat of that inward Retirement of
the Mind which we speak of: And indeed where true Repentance
goeth first, we do not doubt but the Spirit of God will be near
to concur with, and influence such to pray to and call upon
God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 6.</span>And <i>Lastly</i>, They object, <i>That many Prayers begun without the Spirit
have proved effectual; and that the Prayers of wicked Men have been heard,
and found acceptable, as </i>Ahab<i>’s.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This Objection was before solved. For the Acts of God’s Compassion
and Indulgence at some Times, and to some Persons, upon
singular extraordinary Occasions, are not to be a Rule of our Actions.
For if we should make that the Measure of our Obedience,
great Inconveniences would follow; as is evident, and will be acknowledged
by all. Next, We do not deny, but wicked Men are
sensible of the Motions and Operations of God’s Spirit oftentimes,
before their Day be expired; from which they may at Times pray
acceptably; not as remaining altogether wicked, but as entering
into Piety, from whence they afterwards fall away.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">III.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Of singing </i>Psalms.</span>
As to the <i>Singing of Psalms</i>, there will not be need of
any long Discourse; for that the Case is just the same as in the
two former of <i>Preaching</i> and <i>Prayer</i>. We confess this to be a Part
of God’s Worship, and very sweet and refreshing, when it proceeds
from a true Sense of God’s Love in the Heart, and arises from the
divine Influence of the Spirit,
<span class="sidenote"><i>A sweet harmonious Sound</i>.</span>which leads Souls to breathe forth
either a sweet Harmony, or Words suitable to the present Condition;
whether they be Words formerly used by the Saints, and recorded
in Scripture, such as the <i>Psalms</i> of <i>David</i>, or other Words;
as were the Hymns and Songs of <i>Zacharias</i>, <i>Simeon</i>, and the blessed
Virgin <i>Mary</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>But formal Singing has no Ground in </i>Scripture.</span>But as for the formal customary Way of <i>Singing</i>, it
hath no Foundation in Scripture, nor any Ground in true Christianity:
Yea, besides all the Abuses incident to <i>Prayer</i> and <i>Preaching</i>,
it hath this more peculiar, that oftentimes great and horrid
Lies are said in the Sight of God:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Profane Singing of </i>David<i>’s Conditions refuted.</i></span>For all Manner of wicked profane
People take upon them to personate the Experiences and Conditions
of blessed <i>David</i>; which are not only false, as to them, but
also as to some of more Sobriety, who utter them forth: As where
they will sing sometimes, <i>Psalm</i> xxii. 14.&mdash;<i>My Heart is like Wax, it is
melted in the Midst of my Bowels</i>: And Ver. 15. <i>My Strength is dried up
like a Potsherd, and my Tongue cleaveth to my Jaws; and thou hast brought
me into the Dust of Death</i>: And <i>Psalm</i> vi. 6. <i>I am weary with my Groaning,
all the Night make I my Bed to swim: I water my Couch with my Tears</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>
And many more, which those that speak know to be false, as to
them. And sometimes will confess just after, in their Prayers, that
they are guilty of the Vices opposite to those Virtues, which but
just before they have asserted themselves endued with. Who can
suppose that God accepts of such Juggling? And indeed such <i>Singing</i>
doth more please the carnal Ears of Men, than the pure Ears of
the Lord, who abhors all Lying and Hypocrisy.</div>

<p>That <i>Singing</i> then that pleaseth him must proceed from that
which is <i>PURE in the Heart</i> (even from the <i>Word of Life</i> therein)
in and by which, richly dwelling in us, <i>spiritual Songs</i> and <i>Hymns</i>
are returned to the Lord, according to that of the Apostle, <i>Col.</i>
iii. 16.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Artificial Musick.</i></span>But as to their <i>artificial Musick</i>, either by Organs, or other Instruments,
or Voice, we have neither Example nor Precept for it
in the New Testament.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XXVII.</h3> But <i>Lastly</i>, The great Advantage of this true <i>Worship
of God</i>, which we profess and practise, is, that it consisteth not in
Man’s Wisdom, Arts or Industry;
<span class="sidenote"><i>No Splendor of this </i>World<i> attends this inward Worship</i>.</span>neither needeth the Glory, Pomp,
Riches, nor Splendor of this World to beautify it, as being of a
spiritual and heavenly Nature; and therefore too simple and contemptible
to the natural Mind and Will of Man, that hath no Delight
to abide in it, because he finds no Room there for his Imaginations
and Inventions, and hath not the Opportunity to gratify
his outward and carnal Senses: So that this Form being observed,
is not likely to be long kept pure without the Power; for it
is of itself so naked without it, that it hath nothing in it to invite
and tempt Men to dote upon it, further than it is accompanied
with the Power.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The carnal </i>Worship<i> pleases Self.</i></span>Whereas the Worship of our Adversaries, being
performed in their own Wills, is self-pleasing, as in which they
can largely exercise their natural Parts and Invention: And so (as
to most of them) having somewhat of an outward and worldly
Splendor, delectable to the carnal and worldly Senses, they can
pleasantly continue it, and satisfy themselves, though without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span>
Spirit and Power; which they make no Ways essential to the Performance
of their Worship, and therefore neither wait for, nor expect
it.</div>

<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Worship<i> of the </i>Quakers.</span>So that to conclude, The Worship, Preaching, Praying

Spirit of God, and is always accompanied with its Influence, being begun by
its Motion, and carried on by the Power and Strength thereof; and so is a

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> I did sufficiently demonstrate, in the Explanation and Proof
of the former Proposition, how greatly the <i>Professors</i> of
<i>Christianity</i>, as well <i>Protestants</i> as <i>Papists</i>, were degenerated in the Matter
of <i>Worship</i>, and how much Strangers to, and averse from that
true and acceptable <i>Worship</i> that is performed in the <i>Spirit of Truth</i>,
because of Man’s natural Propensity in his fallen State to exalt his
own <i>Inventions</i>, and to intermix his own <i>Work</i> and <i>Product</i> in the
Service of God:
<span class="sidenote"><i>From whence Idolatries and Heathen Superstitions did spring.</i></span>And from this Root sprung all the idle Worships,
Idolatries, and numerous superstitious Inventions among the <i>Heathens</i>.
For when God, in Condescension to his chosen People the
<i>Jews</i>, did prescribe to them by his Servant <i>Moses</i> many <i>Ceremonies</i> and
<i>Observations</i>, as <i>Types</i> and <i>Shadows</i> of the <i>Substance</i>, which in due Time
was to be revealed; which consisted for the most Part in Washings,
outward Purifications and Cleansings, which were to continue until
the Time of <i>Reformation</i>, until the <i>spiritual Worship</i> should be set up;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
and that God, by the more plentiful pouring forth of his <i>Spirit</i>, and
guiding of that <i>Anointing</i>, should lead his <i>Children into all Truth</i>,
and teach them to worship him in a Way more spiritual and acceptable
to him, though less agreeable to the carnal and outward Senses;
yet, notwithstanding <i>God’s Condescension</i> to the <i>Jews</i> in such Things,
we see that that Part in Man, which delights to follow its own <i>Inventions</i>,
could not be restrained, nor yet satisfied with all these <i>Observations</i>,
but that oftentimes they would be either declining to the
other <i>Superstitions</i> of the <i>Gentiles</i>, or adding some new Observations
and Ceremonies of their own; to which they were so devoted, that
they were still apt to prefer them before the Commands of God, and
that under the Notion of <i>Zeal</i> and <i>Piety</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Pharisees<i> the </i>chiefest<i> among the </i>Jews.</span>This we see abundantly
in the Example of the <i>Pharisees</i>, the chief Sect among the <i>Jews</i>,
whom Christ so frequently reproves, <i>For making void the Commandments
of God by their Traditions</i>, Matt. xv. 6. 9. <i>&amp;c.</i> This Complaint may
at this Day be no less justly made as to many bearing the <i>Name</i> of
<i>Christians</i>, who have introduced many Things of this Kind, partly
borrowed from the <i>Jews</i>, which they more tenaciously stick to, and
more earnestly contend for, than for the weightier Points of <i>Christianity</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Many Things in Christendom are borrowed from the</i> Jews <i>and</i> Gentiles.</span>because that <i>Self</i>, yet alive, and ruling in them, loves their
own <i>Inventions</i> better than God’s <i>Commands</i>. But if they can by any
Means stretch any <i>Scripture Practice</i>, or <i>conditional Precept</i> or <i>Permission</i>,
fitted to the Weakness or Capacity of some, or appropriate to some
particular Dispensation, to give some Colour for any of these their
<i>Inventions</i>; they do then so tenaciously stick to them, and so obstinately
and obstreperously plead for them, that they will not patiently
hear the most solid <i>Christian</i> Reasons against them. Which Zeal, if
they would but seriously examine it, they would find to be but the
Prejudice of <i>Education</i>, and the Love of <i>Self</i>, more than that of <i>God</i>,
or his <i>pure Worship</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of </i>Sacraments<i> so many </i>Controversies.</span>This is verified concerning those Things which
are called <i>Sacraments</i>, about which they are very ignorant in <i>Religious
Controversies</i>, who understand not how much Debate, Contention,
Jangling, and Quarrelling there has been among those called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span>
<i>Christians</i>: So that I may safely say the <i>Controversy</i> about them, to wit,
about their <i>Number</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Virtue</i>, <i>Efficacy</i>, <i>Administration</i>, and other
Things, hath been more than about any other <i>Doctrine</i> of <i>Christ</i>, whether
as betwixt <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, or among <i>Protestants</i> betwixt
themselves. And how great Prejudice these <i>Controversies</i> have brought
to <i>Christians</i> is very obvious; whereas the Things contended for
among them are for the most Part but empty Shadows, and mere
outside Things: As I hope hereafter to make appear to the patient
and unprejudiced Reader.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Name of </i>Sacrament<i> (not found in </i>Scripture<i>) is borrowed from the </i>Heathen.</span>That which comes first under Observation, is the Name
[<i>Sacrament</i>] which it is strange that <i>Christians</i> should stick to and
contend so much for, since it is not to be found in all the <i>Scripture</i>;
but was borrowed from the <i>military Oaths</i> among the <i>Heathens</i>, from
whom the <i>Christians</i>, when they began to <i>apostatize</i>, did borrow many
<i>superstitious Terms</i> and <i>Observations</i>, that they might thereby ingratiate
themselves, and the more easily gain the <i>Heathens</i> to their <i>Religion</i>;
which Practice, though perhaps intended by them for Good, yet, as
being the Fruit of <i>human Policy</i>, and not according to <i>God’s Wisdom</i>,
has had very pernicious Consequences. I see not how any, whether
<i>Papists</i> or <i>Protestants</i>, especially the latter, can in Reason quarrel
with us for denying this Term, which it seems the Spirit of
God saw not meet to inspire the Penmen of the Scriptures to leave
unto us.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>But if it be said, That <i>it is not the Name, but the Thing they contend
for</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; Let the Name then, as not being <i>scriptural</i>, be laid aside,
and we shall see at first Entrance how much Benefit will redound by
laying aside this traditional Term, and betaking us to Plainness of
<i>Scripture Language</i>. For presently the great Contest about the Number
of them will vanish; seeing there is no Term used in Scripture
that can be made use of, whether we call them <i>Institutions</i>, <i>Ordinances</i>,
<i>Precepts</i>, <i>Commandments</i>, <i>Appointments</i>, or <i>Laws</i>, &amp;c. that would afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
Ground for such a Debate; since neither will <i>Papists</i> affirm, that there
are only <i>seven</i>, or <i>Protestants</i> only <i>two</i>, of any of these aforementioned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>If it be said, That this <i>Controversy arises from the Definition of the
Thing, as well as from the Name</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> <i>The </i>Definition<i> of </i>Sacrament<i> agrees to many other Things.</i></span>It will be found otherwise: For whatever Way we take their Definition
of a <i>Sacrament</i>, whether as an <i>outward visible Sign, whereby inward
Grace is conferred, or only signified</i>, this Definition will agree to
many Things, which neither <i>Papists</i> nor <i>Protestants</i> will acknowledge
to be <i>Sacraments</i>. If they be expressed under the Name of <i>sealing Ordinances</i>,
as by some they are, I could never see, either by Reason
or Scripture, how this Title could be appropriate to them, more
than to any other <i>Christian</i>, <i>religious Performance</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>What </i>sealing Ordinance<i> doth mean.</i></span>For that must needs
properly be a <i>sealing Ordinance</i>, which makes the <i>Persons</i> receiving it
<i>infallibly certain of the Promise</i> or Thing <i>sealed to them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span>If it be said, <i>It is so to them that are faithful</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; So is Praying and Preaching, and doing of every good
Work. Seeing the Partaking or Performing of the one gives not to
any a more certain Title to Heaven, yea, in some Respect, not so
much, there is no Reason to call them so, more than the other.</p>

<p>Besides, we find not any Thing called the <i>Seal</i> and <i>Pledge</i> of our
<i>Inheritance</i>, but the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>God</i>. It is by that we are said to be
sealed, Ephes. i. 14. and iv. 30. which is also termed the <i>Earnest of
our Inheritance</i>, 2 Cor. i. 22. and not by <i>outward Water</i>, or <i>Eating</i> and
<i>Drinking</i>; which as the wickedest of Men may partake of, so many
that do, do, notwithstanding it, go to Perdition.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That</i> outward Washing <i>doth not cleanse the</i> Heart.</span>For it is not
<i>outward Washing with Water</i> that maketh the <i>Heart clean</i>, by which
Men are fitted for Heaven: And as that <i>which goeth into the Mouth
doth not defile a Man, because it is put forth again</i>, and so goeth to the
<i>Dunghill</i>; neither doth any Thing which Man eateth purify him,
or fit him for Heaven. What is said here in general may serve
for an Introduction, not only to this Proposition, but also to the
other concerning the <i>Supper</i>. Of these <i>Sacraments</i> (so called) <i>Baptism</i>
is always first numbered, which is the Subject of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span>
Proposition; in the Explanation of which I shall first demonstrate and
prove our Judgment, and then answer the Objections, and refute the
Sentiments of our Opposers.
<span class="sidenote">Part I.</span>As to the first Part, these Things following,
which are briefly comprehended in the Proposition, come
to be proposed and proved.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Prop. I.</span>First, <i>There is but one Baptism</i>, as well as but <i>one Lord, one
Faith</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. II.</span>Secondly, <i>That this one Baptism, which is the Baptism of Christ, is not
a Washing with, or Dipping in Water, but a being baptised by the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. III.</span>Thirdly, <i>That the Baptism of </i>John<i> was but a Figure of this; and therefore,
as the Figure, to give Place to the Substance; which though it be to continue,
yet the other ceaseth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. I.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>One Baptism proved.</i></span>
As for the First, viz. <i>That there is but one Baptism</i>, there needs no
other Proof than the Words of the Text, <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 5. <i>One Lord</i>, <i>one
Faith</i>, <i>one Baptism</i>: Where the Apostle positively and plainly affirms,
that as there is but <i>one Body</i>, <i>one Spirit</i>, <i>one Faith</i>, <i>one God</i>, &amp;c. so
there is but <i>one Baptism</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>As to what is commonly alleged by Way of Explanation upon
the Text, <i>That the Baptism of Water and of the Spirit make up this one
Baptism, by Virtue of the sacramental Union</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; This Exposition hath taken Place, not because grounded
upon the Testimony of the Scripture, but because it wrests the Scripture
to make it suit to their Principle of <i>Water-baptism</i>; and so there
needs no other Reply, but to deny it, as being repugnant to the
plain Words of the Text;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether </i>two Baptisms<i> make up the </i>One.</span>which saith not, <i>That there are two Baptisms</i>,
to wit, one of <i>Water</i>, the other of the <i>Spirit</i>, which do make
up <i>one Baptism</i>; but plainly, <i>that there is one Baptism</i>, as there is <i>one
Faith</i>, and <i>one God</i>. Now as there go not <i>two Faiths</i>, nor <i>two Gods</i>,
nor <i>two Spirits</i>, nor two <i>Bodies</i>, whereof the one is outward and
elementary, and the other spiritual and pure, to the making up the
<i>one Faith</i>, the <i>one God</i>, the <i>one Body</i>, and the <i>one Spirit</i>; so neither
ought there to go <i>two Baptisms</i> to make up the <i>one Baptism</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>But <i>Secondly</i>, if it be said, <i>The Baptism is but one, whereof Water is
the one Part, to wit, the Sign; and the Spirit, the Thing signified, the
other</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>If </i>Water<i> be the Type, the Substance must remain.</i></span>
I <i>answer</i>; This yet more confirmeth our Doctrine: For if Water
be only the <i>Sign</i>, it is not the <i>Matter</i> of the <i>one Baptism</i> (as shall further
hereafter by its Definition in Scripture appear) and we are to
take the <i>one Baptism</i> for the <i>Matter</i> of it, not for the <i>Sign</i>, or <i>Figure</i>
and <i>Type</i> that went before. Even as where Christ is called the <i>one
Offering</i> in Scripture, though he was typified by many <i>Sacrifices</i> and
<i>Offerings</i> under the Law, we understand only by the <i>one Offering</i>,
his offering himself upon the Cross; whereof though those many
<i>Offerings</i> were Signs and Types, yet we say not that they go together
with that <i>Offering of Christ</i>, to make up the <i>one Offering</i>: So neither,
though <i>Water-baptism</i> was a Sign of Christ’s <i>Baptism</i>, will it follow,
that it goeth now to make up the <i>Baptism of Christ</i>. If any should
be so absurd as to affirm, <i>That this one Baptism here was the Baptism of
Water, and not of the Spirit</i>; that were foolishly to contradict the positive
Testimony of the Scripture, which saith the contrary; as by
what followeth will more amply appear.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prop. II.</span><i>Secondly, That this </i>one Baptism<i>, which is the </i>Baptism<i> of </i>Christ<i>, is
not a Washing with Water</i>, appears,
<span class="sidenote">Proof 1. <i>The Difference between </i>John<i>’s Baptism and </i>Christ<i>’s</i>.</span><i>First</i>, From the Testimony of <i>John</i>,
the proper and peculiar Administrator of Water-baptism, <i>Matt.</i>
iii. 11. <i>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance; but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose Shoes I am not worthy to bear; he
shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire</i>. Here <i>John</i> mentions
two Manners of <i>baptizing</i>, and two different <i>Baptisms</i>; the one with
Water, and the other with the Spirit; the one whereof he was the
Minister of; the other whereof Christ was the Minister of: And
such as were baptized with the first, were not therefore baptized
with the second: <i>I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you</i>. Though
in the present Time they were baptized with the Baptism of Water;
yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the Baptism
of Christ. From all which I thus argue:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 1.</span>If those that were baptized with the Baptism of Water, were
not therefore baptized with the Baptism of Christ; then the Baptism
of Water is not the Baptism of Christ:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore also the Last.</p>

<p class="in4">And again,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 2.</span>If he, that truly and really administred the Baptism of Water,
did notwithstanding declare, that he neither could, nor did, baptize
with the Baptism of Christ; then the Baptism of Water is not
the Baptism of Christ:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>And indeed to understand it otherwise, would make <i>John</i>’s Words
void of good Sense: For if their Baptisms had been all one, why
should he have so precisely contra-distinguished them? Why should
he have said, That those whom he had already baptized, should
yet be baptized with another Baptism?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be urged, <i>That Baptism with Water was the one Part, and that
with the Spirit the other Part, or Effect only of the former</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; This Exposition contradicts the plain Words of the
Text.
<span class="sidenote"><i>One </i>Baptism<i> is no Part nor Effect of the other.</i></span>For he saith not, <i>I baptize you with Water, and he that cometh
after me shall produce the Effects of this my Baptism in you by the Spirit</i>, &amp;c.
or <i>he shall accomplish this Baptism in you</i>; but, <i>He shall baptize you</i>. So
then, if we understand the Words truly and properly, when he
saith, <i>I baptize you</i>, as consenting that thereby is really signified that
he did baptize with the Baptism of Water; we must needs, unless
we offer Violence to the Text, understand the other Part of the
Sentence the same Way; <i>viz.</i> where he adds presently, <i>But he shall
baptize you</i>, &amp;c. that he understood it of their being truly to be baptized
with another Baptism, than what he did baptize with: Else
it had been Nonsense for him thus to have contra-distinguished
them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, This is further confirmed by the Saying of Christ himself,
<i>Acts</i> i. 4, 5. <i>But wait for the Promise of the Father, which, saith he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
ye have heard of me: For </i>John<i> truly baptized with Water, but ye shall be
baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many Days hence.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Who were baptized by </i>John<i> were still to wait for </i>Christ<i>’s </i>Baptism<i> with the Spirit.</i></span>There can scarce
two Places of Scripture run more parallel than this doth with the
former, a little before-mentioned; and therefore concludeth the
same Way as did the other. For Christ here grants fully that <i>John</i>
compleated his Baptism, as to the Matter and Substance of it:
<i>John</i>, saith he, <i>truly baptized with Water</i>; which is as much as if he
had said, <i>John</i> did truly and fully administer the Baptism of Water;
<i>But ye shall be baptized with</i>, &amp;c. This sheweth that they were to be
baptized with some other Baptism than the Baptism of Water; and
that although they were formerly baptized with the Baptism of Water,
yet not with that of Christ, which they were to be baptized with.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 3.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Baptism with the </i>Holy Ghost<i> and that with </i>Water<i> differ.</i></span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Peter</i> observes the same Distinction, <i>Acts</i> xi. 16. <i>Then remembered
I the Word of the Lord, how that he said, </i>John<i> indeed baptized
with Water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</i> The Apostle
makes this Application upon the <i>Holy Ghost</i>’s Falling upon them;
whence he infers, that they were then baptized with the Baptism of
the Spirit. As to what is urged from his calling afterwards for
<i>Water</i>, it shall be spoken to hereafter. From all which <i>three Sentences</i>,
relative one to another, first of <i>John</i>, secondly of <i>Christ</i>, and thirdly
of <i>Peter</i>, it doth evidently follow, that such as were truly and really
baptized with the Baptism of Water, were notwithstanding not baptized
with the Baptism of the Spirit, which is that of Christ; and
such as truly and really did administer the Baptism of Water, did, in
so doing, not administer the Baptism of Christ. So that if there be
now but <i>one Baptism</i>, as we have already proved, we may safely conclude
that it is that of the <i>Spirit</i>, and not of <i>Water</i>; else it would follow,
that the <i>one Baptism</i>, which now continues, were the <i>Baptism of
Water</i>, i. e. <i>John</i>’s Baptism, and not the <i>Baptism of the Spirit</i>, i. e.
<i>Christ</i>’s; which were most absurd.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said further, <i>That though the Baptism of </i>John<i>, before </i>Christ<i>’s
was administred, was different from it, as being the Figure only; yet now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
that both it as the Figure, and that of the Spirit as the Substance, is necessary
to make up the one Baptism</i>;</p>

<p>I <i>answer</i>; This urgeth nothing, unless it be granted also that
both of them belong to the Essence of <i>Baptism</i>; so that <i>Baptism</i> is not
to be accounted as truly administred, where both are not; which
none of our Adversaries will acknowledge: But on the contrary,
account not only all those truly baptized with the <i>Baptism of Christ</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Water-baptism is not the true Baptism of </i>Christ.</span>who are baptized with <i>Water</i>, though they be uncertain whether
they be baptized with the <i>Spirit</i>, or not; but they even account such
truly baptized with the <i>Baptism of Christ</i>, because <i>sprinkled</i>, or baptized
with Water, though it be manifest and most certain that they
are not baptized with the Spirit, as being Enemies thereunto in
their Hearts by wicked Works. So here, by their own Confession,
<i>Baptism with Water</i> is without the Spirit. Wherefore we may far
safer conclude, that the <i>Baptism of the Spirit</i>, which is that of <i>Christ</i>,
is and may be without that of <i>Water</i>; as appears in that of <i>Acts</i> xi.
where <i>Peter</i> testifies of these Men, that <i>they were baptized with the Spirit</i>,
though then not <i>baptized with Water</i>. And indeed the Controversy
in this, as in most other Things, stands betwixt us and our
Opposers, in that they oftentimes prefer the Form and Shadow to
the Power and Substance; by denominating Persons as Inheritors
and Possessors of the Thing, from their having the Form and Shadow,
though really wanting the Power and Substance; and not admitting
those to be so denominated, who have the Power and Substance,
if they want the Form and Shadow. This appears evidently,
in that they account those truly <i>baptized</i> with the <i>one Baptism
of Christ</i>, who are not baptized with the <i>Spirit</i> (which in Scripture is
particularly called the <i>Baptism of Christ</i>) if they be only baptized with
Water, which themselves yet confess to be but the Shadow or Figure.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Baptism of the Spirit needeth no Sprinkling or Dipping in Water.</i></span>And moreover, in that they account not those who are
surely baptized with the <i>Baptism of the Spirit</i> baptized, neither will
they have them so denominated, unless they be also <i>sprinkled</i> with,
or <i>dipped</i> in Water: But we, on the contrary, do always prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>
the Power to the Form, the Substance to the Shadow; and where
the Substance and Power is, we doubt not to denominate the Person
accordingly, though the Form be wanting. And therefore we
always seek First, and plead for the Substance and Power, as knowing
that to be indispensibly necessary, though the Form sometimes
may be dispensed with, and the Figure or Type may cease, when
the Substance and Anti-type come to be enjoyed, as it doth in this
Case, which shall hereafter be made appear.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Proof 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, That the <i>one Baptism of Christ</i> is not a Washing
with Water, appears from 1 <i>Pet.</i> iii. 21. <i>The like Figure<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> whereunto
even Baptism doth also now save us (not the putting <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: away the">away of the</span> Filth of the
Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience towards God) by the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ</i>. So plain a Definition of <i>Baptism</i> is not in all the
Bible; and therefore, seeing it is so plain, it may well be preferred
to all the coined Definitions of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Schoolmen">School-men</span>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The plainest Definition of the Baptism of Christ in all the Bible</i>.</span>The Apostle tells
us, first <i>negatively</i>, what it is not, viz. <i>Not a putting away of the Filth of the
Flesh</i>: Then surely it is not a <i>Washing</i> with Water, since that is so.
<i>Secondly</i>, He tells us <i>affirmatively</i> what it is, viz. <i>The Answer of a good
Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ</i>; where he affirmatively
defines it to be the <i>Answer</i> (or <i>Confession</i>, as the <i>Syriack</i>
Version hath it) <i>of a good Conscience</i>. Now this <i>Answer</i> cannot be
but where the Spirit of God hath purified the Soul, and the Fire
of his Judgment hath burned up the unrighteous Nature; and those
in whom this Work is wrought may be truly said to be <i>baptized with
the Baptism of Christ</i>, i. e. <i>of the Spirit and of Fire</i>. Whatever Way
then we take this Definition of the Apostle of <i>Christ’s Baptism</i>, it confirmeth
our Sentence: For if we take the first or negative Part, viz.
<i>That it is not a putting away of the Filth of the Flesh</i>, then it will follow
that <i>Water-baptism</i> is not it, because that <i>is a putting <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: away the">away of the</span> Filth of the
Flesh</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Water-baptism shut out from the Baptism of Christ.</i></span>If we take the second and affirmative Definition, to wit, <i>That it
is the Answer</i> or Confession <i>of a good Conscience</i>, &amp;c. then <i>Water-baptism</i> is
not it; since, as our Adversaries will not deny, <i>Water-baptism</i> doth not
always imply it, neither is it any necessary Consequence thereof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
Moreover, the Apostle in this Place doth seem especially to guard
against those that might esteem <i>Water-baptism</i> the true <i>Baptism of Christ</i>;
because (lest by the Comparison induced by him in the preceding
Verse, betwixt the Souls that were saved in <i>Noah</i>’s Ark, and us that are
now saved by <i>Baptism</i>; lest, I say, any should have thence hastily concluded,
that because the Former were saved by <i>Water</i>, this Place
must needs be taken to speak of <i>Water-baptism</i>) to prevent such a
Mistake, he plainly affirms, that it is not that, but another Thing.
He saith not that it is the <i>Water</i>, or <i>the putting away of the Filth of the
Flesh, as accompanied with the Answer of a good Conscience, whereof the one</i>,
viz. <i>Water, is the sacramental Element, administered by the Minister; and
the other, the Grace or Thing signified, conferred by Christ</i>; but plainly,
<i>That it is not the putting away</i>, &amp;c. than which there can be nothing
more manifest to Men unprejudicate and judicious. Moreover <i>Peter</i>
calls this here which saves [Greek: antitypon: αντιτυπον], the <i>Anti-type</i>, or the <i>Thing
figured</i>; whereas it is usually translated, as if <i>the like Figure did now save
us</i>; thereby insinuating that as they were saved by Water in the
Ark, so are we now by <i>Water-baptism</i>. But this Interpretation crosseth
his Sense, he presently after declaring the contrary, as hath
above been observed; and likewise it would contradict the Opinion
of all our Opposers.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestants<i> denying </i>Water-baptism<i> its absolute Necessity to </i>Men’s Salvation<i>; although the </i>Papists<i> say, </i>None can be saved without it<i>, yet grant Exceptions.</i></span>For <i>Protestants</i> deny it to be absolutely necessary
to Salvation; and though <i>Papists</i> say, <i>none are saved without it</i>,
yet in this they admit an Exception, as of <i>Martyrs</i>, &amp;c. and they
will not say that all that have it are saved by <i>Water-baptism</i>; which
they ought to say, if they will understand by <i>Baptism</i> (by which the
Apostle saith we are saved) <i>Water-baptism</i>. For seeing we are saved
<i>by this Baptism</i>, as all those that were in the Ark <i>were saved by Water</i>,
it would then follow, that all those that have this <i>Baptism</i> are saved by
it. Now this Consequence would be false, if it were understood of
<i>Water-baptism</i>; because many, by the Confession of all, are <i>baptized</i> with
<i>Water</i> that are not saved; but this Consequence holds most true, if it be
understood as we do, of the <i>Baptism</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>; since none can have
this Answer of a good Conscience, and, abiding in it, not be saved by it.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>[Pg 366]</span></p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Proof 5.</span>Fifthly, <i>That the one Baptism of Christ is not a Washing with Water</i>, as it
hath been proved by the Definition of the <i>one Baptism</i>, so it is also manifest
from the necessary Fruits and Effects of it, which are three Times
particularly expressed by the Apostle <i>Paul</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Effects and Fruits of the Baptism of </i>Christ.</span>as first, <i>Rom.</i> vi. 3, 4. where
he saith, <i>That so many of them as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
into his Death, buried with him by Baptism into Death, that they should walk in
Newness of Life</i>. Secondly, to the <i>Galatians</i> iii. 27. he saith positively,
<i>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</i>. And
thirdly, to the <i>Colossians</i> ii. 12. he saith, That they were <i>buried with
him in Baptism</i>, and risen <i>with him through the Faith of the Operation of
God</i>. It is to be observed here, that the Apostle speaks generally,
without any <i>exclusive Term</i>, but <i>comprehensive</i> of all. He saith not,
<i>Some of you that were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</i>, but <i>as many
of you</i>; which is as much as if he had said, <i>Every one of you that hath
been baptized into Christ, hath put on Christ</i>. Whereby it is evident that
this is not meant of <i>Water-baptism</i>, but of the <i>Baptism</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Which Effects</i> Water-baptism <i>wants</i>.</span>because else it would follow, that whosoever had been <i>baptized</i> with
<i>Water-baptism</i> had put on <i>Christ</i>, and were <i>risen</i> with him, which all
acknowledge to be most absurd. Now supposing all the visible
Members of the Churches of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Galatia</i>, and <i>Colosse</i> had been
outwardly baptized with Water (I do not say they were, but our
Adversaries will not only readily grant it, but also contend for it)
suppose, I say, the Case so, they will not say they had <i>all put on
Christ</i>, since divers Expressions in these <i>Epistles</i> to them shew the contrary.
So that the Apostle cannot mean <i>Baptism</i> with <i>Water</i>; and
yet that he meaneth the <i>Baptism</i> of <i>Christ</i>, i. e. <i>of the Spirit</i>, cannot be
denied; or that the <i>Baptism</i> wherewith these were <i>baptized</i> (of whom
the Apostle here testifies that they had <i>put on Christ</i>) was the <i>one Baptism</i>,
I think none will call in Question. Now admit, as our Adversaries
contend, that many in these Churches who had been <i>baptized</i>
with <i>Water</i> had not <i>put on Christ</i>, it will follow, that notwithstanding
that <i>Water-baptism</i>, they were not baptized <i>into Christ</i>, or with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
Baptism of <i>Christ</i>, seeing <i>as many of them as were baptized</i> into <i>Christ had
put on Christ</i>, &amp;c. From all which I thus argue:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 1.</span><i>If the </i>Baptism<i> with </i>Water<i> were the one </i>Baptism<i>, </i>i. e.<i> the </i>Baptism<i>
of </i>Christ<i>, as many as were baptized with </i>Water<i> would have put on
Christ</i>:</p>

<p>But the Last is false: Therefore also the First.</p>

<p class="in4">And again:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 2.</span><i>Since as many as are baptized into </i>Christ, i. e.<i> with the </i>one Baptism,<i>
which is the </i>Baptism<i> of </i>Christ,<i> have put on </i>Christ,<i> then </i>Water-baptism<i>
is not the one </i>Baptism,<i> viz. the </i>Baptism<i> of </i>Christ:</p>

<p>But the First is true: Therefore also the Last.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Prop. III.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>Proved.</i></span>
Thirdly, <i>Since </i>John’s Baptism<i> was a Figure, and seeing the
Figure gives Way to the Substance, although the Thing figured remain, to
wit, the </i>one Baptism<i> of </i>Christ,<i> yet the other ceaseth, which was the </i>Baptism<i>
of </i>John.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">I.</span><span class="sidenote">John<i>’s Baptism was a Figure of </i>Christ<i>’s.</i></span>
That <i>John</i>’s Baptism was a Figure of <i>Christ</i>’s Baptism, I judge
will not readily be denied; but in Case it should, it can easily
be proved from the Nature of it. <i>John</i>’s Baptism was <i>a being baptized
with Water</i>, but <i>Christ</i>’s is <i>a Baptizing with the Spirit</i>; therefore
<i>John</i>’s Baptism must have been a Figure of <i>Christ</i>’s. But further,
that Water-Baptism was <i>John</i>’s Baptism, will not be denied: That
Water-baptism is not <i>Christ</i>’s Baptism, is already proved. From
which doth arise the Confirmation of our Proposition thus:</p>

<p>There is no Baptism to continue now, but the <i>one Baptism</i> of
Christ:</p>

<p>Therefore <i>Water-baptism</i> is not to continue now, because it is not
the one Baptism of <i>Christ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">II.</span><span class="sidenote">John<i>’s Baptism is ceased our Opposers confess.</i></span>
That <i>John</i>’s Baptism is ceased, many of our Adversaries confess;
but if any should allege it is otherwise, it may be easily proved by
the express Words of <i>John</i>, not only as being insinuated there,
where he contra-distinguisheth his Baptism from that of <i>Christ</i>, but
particularly where he saith, <i>John</i> iii. 30. <i>He</i> [Christ] <i>must increase,
but I</i> [John] <i>must decrease</i>. From whence it clearly follows, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>[Pg 368]</span>
<i>Increasing</i> or taking Place of <i>Christ</i>’s Baptism is the <i>Decreasing</i> or
Abolishing of <i>John</i>’s Baptism; so that if Water-baptism was a particular
Part of <i>John</i>’s Ministry, and is no Part of <i>Christ</i>’s Baptism, as we have
already proved, it will necessarily follow that it is not to continue.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>Secondly, <i>if </i>Water-baptism<i> had been to continue a perpetual Ordinance
of Christ in his Church, he would either have practised it himself, or
commanded his Apostles so to do</i>.</p>

<p>But that he practised it not, the <i>Scripture</i> plainly affirms, <i>John</i>
iv. 2. And that he commanded his Disciples to <i>baptize</i> with <i>Water</i>,
I could never yet read. As for what is alleged, that, <i>Matt.</i> xxviii.
19. &amp;c. where he bids them <i>baptize</i>, is to be understood of <i>Water-baptism</i>,
that is but to beg the Question, and the Grounds for that shall
be hereafter examined.</p>

<p><i>Therefore to </i>baptize<i> with </i>Water<i> is no perpetual Ordinance of Christ to
his Church.</i></p>

<p>This hath had the more Weight with me, because I find not any
standing <i>Ordinance or Appointment</i> of <i>Christ</i> necessary to Christians, for
which we have not either Christ’s own Practice or Command, as to
obey all the Commandments which comprehend both our Duty towards
God and Man, <i>&amp;c.</i> and where the <i>Gospel</i> requires more than
the <i>Law</i>, which is abundantly signified in the 5th and 6th Chapters
of <i>Matthew</i>, and elsewhere. Besides, as to the Duties of Worship,
he exhorts us to meet, promising his Presence; commands to
<i>pray</i>, <i>preach</i>, <i>watch</i>, &amp;c. and gives Precepts concerning some temporary
Things, as the <i>Washing</i> of <i>one another’s Feet</i>, the <i>Breaking</i> of
<i>Bread</i>, hereafter to be discussed; only for this one Thing of <i>Baptizing</i>
with <i>Water</i>, though so earnestly contended for, we find not
any Precept of Christ.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">III.</span><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Gospel<i> puts an End to </i>carnal Ordinances.</span>
But to make Water-baptism a necessary <i>Institution</i> of the
<i>Christian Religion</i>, which is pure and spiritual, and not carnal and
ceremonial, is to derogate from the <i>New Covenant Dispensation</i>, and
set up the <i>legal Rites</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i>, of which this of <i>Baptism</i>, or
<i>Washing</i> with <i>Water</i>, was one, as appears from <i>Heb.</i> ix. 10. where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>[Pg 369]</span>
the Apostle speaking thereof saith, that it stood <i>only in Meats and
Drinks, and divers Baptisms, and carnal Ordinances, imposed until the Time
of Reformation</i>. If then the Time of Reformation, or the Dispensation
of the <i>Gospel</i>, which puts an End to the Shadows, be come,
then such <i>Baptisms</i> and carnal <i>Ordinances</i> are no more to be imposed.
For how Baptism with <i>Water</i> comes now to be a <i>Spiritual Ordinance</i>,
more than before in the Time of the <i>Law</i>, doth not appear, seeing
it is but <i>Water</i> still, and a Washing of the outward Man, and a
putting away of the Filth of the Flesh still: And as before, those
that were so washed, were not thereby made perfect, as pertaining
to the <i>Conscience</i>, neither are they at this Day, as our Adversaries must
needs acknowledge, and Experience abundantly sheweth. So that
the Matter of it, which is a Washing with Water, and the Effect of it,
which is only an outward Cleansing, being still the same, how comes
Water-baptism to be less a carnal Ordinance now than before?</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span>If it be said, That <i>God confers inward Grace upon some that are now
baptized</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>So no Doubt he did also upon some that used those Baptisms
among the <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>Or if it be said, <i>Because it is commanded by Christ now, under the New
Covenant</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, <i>First</i>, That is to beg the Question; of which hereafter.</p>

<p>But <i>Secondly</i>, We find that where the Matter of Ordinances is the
same, and the End the same, they are never accounted more or
less spiritual, because of their different Times. Now was not God
the Author of the <i>Purifications</i> and <i>Baptisms</i> under the <i>Law</i>? Was
not Water the Matter of them, which is so now? Was not the
End of them to signify an inward Purifying by an outward Washing?
And is not that alleged to be the End still?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Men are no more </i>now<i> than </i>before<i> by </i>Water-baptism<i> inwardly cleansed.</i></span>And are the necessary
Effects or Consequences of it any better now than before,
since Men are now by the Virtue of Water-baptism, as a necessary
Consequence of it, no more than before made inwardly clean?
And if some by God’s Grace that are baptized with Water are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>[Pg 370]</span>wardly
purified, so were some also under the Law; so that this is
not any necessary Consequence or Effect, neither of this nor that
Baptism. It is then plainly repugnant to right Reason, as well as
to the Scripture Testimony, to affirm <i>that</i> to be a spiritual Ordinance
now, which was a carnal Ordinance before, if it be still the
same, both as to its Author, Matter, and End, however made to
vary in some small Circumstances. The Spirituality of the <i>New Covenant</i>
and of its <i>Worship</i> established by Christ, consisted not in such
superficial Alterations of Circumstances, but after another Manner.
Therefore let our Adversaries shew us, if they can, without begging
the Question, and building upon some one or other of their own
Principles denied by us, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: where-ever">wherever</span> Christ appointed or ordained
any Institution or Observation under the <i>New Covenant</i>, as belonging
to the Nature of it, or such a necessary Part of its <i>Worship</i> as is
perpetually to continue; which being one in Substance and Effects
(I speak of necessary, not accidental Effects) yet, because of some
small Difference in Form or Circumstance, was before carnal, notwithstanding
it was commanded by God under the <i>Law</i>, but now
is become spiritual, because commanded by Christ under the <i>Gospel</i>?
And if they cannot do this, then if Water-baptism was once a carnal
Ordinance, as the Apostle positively affirms it to have been,
it remains a carnal Ordinance still; and if a carnal Ordinance,
then no necessary Part of the <i>Gospel</i> or <i>New Covenant Dispensation</i>;
and if no necessary Part of it, then not needful to continue,
nor to be practised by such as live and walk under this <i>Dispensation</i>.
But in this, as in most other Things, according as we
have often observed, our Adversaries <i>judaize</i>, and renouncing the
<i>glorious</i> and <i>spiritual Privileges</i> of the New Covenant, are sticking in
and cleaving to the Rudiments of the Old, both in <i>Doctrine</i> and
<i>Worship</i>, as being more suited and agreeable to their carnal Apprehensions
and natural Senses.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Law<i> distinguished from the </i>Gospel.</span>But we, on the contrary, travail
above all to lay hold upon and cleave unto the <i>Light</i> of the <i>glorious
Gospel</i> revealed unto us. And the Harmony of the Truth we profess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>[Pg 371]</span>
in this may appear, by briefly observing how in all Things we
follow the <i>spiritual Gospel of Christ</i>, as contra-distinguished from the
Carnality of the <i>legal Dispensation</i>; while our Adversaries, through
rejecting this <i>Gospel</i>, are still labouring under the Burden of the <i>Law</i>,
which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The outward </i>Baptism<i>, </i>Worship<i>, </i>Law<i>, distinguished from the inward.</i></span><i>For the Law and Rule of the </i>Old Covenant<i> and </i>Jews<i> was outward,
written in Tables of Stone and Parchment; </i>so also is that of our Adversaries<i>.
But the Law of the </i>New Covenant<i> is inward and perpetual,
written in the Heart; </i>so is ours.</p>

<p><i>The Worship of the </i>Jews<i> was outward and carnal, limited to set Times,
Places, and Persons, and performed according to set prescribed Forms and
Observations; </i>so is that of our Adversaries<i>. But the Worship of the </i>New
Covenant<i> is neither limited to Time, Place, nor Person, but is performed in
the Spirit and in Truth; and it is not acted according to set Forms and
Prescriptions, but as the Spirit of God immediately actuates, moves, and
leads, whether it be to preach, pray, or sing; </i>and such is also our Worship.</p>

<p><i>So likewise the </i>Baptism<i> among the </i>Jews<i> under the Law was an </i>outward
Washing<i> with </i>outward Water<i>, only to typify an inward Purification of the
Soul, which did not necessarily follow upon those that were thus baptized</i>;
but the Baptism of Christ under the Gospel is the Baptism of the
Spirit and of Fire; <i>not the putting away of the Filth of the Flesh, but the
Answer of a good Conscience towards God</i>; and such is the Baptism that
we labour to be baptized withal, and contend for.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Arg.</span>But again, If Water-baptism had been an Ordinance of
the Gospel, then the Apostle <i>Paul</i> would have been sent to administer
it; but he declares positively, 1 <i>Cor.</i> i. 17. <i>That Christ sent
him not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</i>. The Reason of that Consequence
is undeniable, because the Apostle <i>Paul</i>’s Commission was
as large as that of any of them; and consequently he being in special
Manner the Apostle of Christ to the <i>Gentiles</i>,
<span class="sidenote">IV. <i>That </i>Water-baptism<i> is no Badge of </i>Christians<i>, like </i>Circumcision<i> of the </i>Jews.</span>if Water-baptism,
as our Adversaries contend, be to be accounted the <i>Badge of Christianity</i>,
he had more Need than any of the rest to be sent to baptize
with Water, that he might mark the <i>Gentiles</i> converted by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>[Pg 372]</span>
with that <i>Christian Sign</i>. But indeed the Reason holds better thus,
that since <i>Paul</i> was the Apostle of the <i>Gentiles</i>, and that in his Ministry
he doth through all (as by his <i>Epistles</i> appears) labour to wean
them from the former <i>Jewish Ceremonies</i> and <i>Observations</i> (though in so
doing he was sometimes undeservedly judged by others of his Brethren,
who were unwilling to lay aside those <i>Ceremonies</i>) therefore
his Commission, though as full as to the Preaching of the <i>Gospel</i> and
<i>New Covenant Dispensation</i> as that of the other Apostles, did not require
of him that he should lead those Converts into such <i>Jewish
Observations</i> and <i>Baptisms</i>, however that Practice was indulged in
and practised by the other Apostles among their <i>Jewish Proselytes</i>; for
which Cause <a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a><i>he thanks God that he had baptized so few</i>: Intimating that
what he did therein he did not by Virtue of his Apostolick Commission,

another Time he circumcised <i>Timothy</i>.</div>

the Instance not sufficient, unless they can prove that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>[Pg 373]</span>
ought so to be admitted here; else we might interpret by the same
Rule all other Places of Scripture the same Way, as where the
Apostle saith, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ii. 5. <i>That your Faith might not stand in the Wisdom
of Men, but in the Power of God</i>, it might be understood, it shall not
stand <i>principally so</i>. How might the Gospel, by this Liberty of Interpretation,
be perverted?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span>If it be said, <i>That the Abuse of this Baptism among the </i>Corinthians<i>,
in dividing themselves according to the Persons by whom they were baptized,
made the Apostle speak so; but that the Abuse of a Thing doth not abolish it</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, It is true, it doth not, provided the Thing be lawful
and necessary; and that no Doubt the Abuse abovesaid gave the
Apostle Occasion so to write. But let it from this be considered how
the Apostle excludes <i>Baptizing</i>, not <i>Preaching</i>, though the Abuse
[mark] proceeded from that, no less than from the other. For
these <i>Corinthians</i> did denominate themselves from those different Persons
by whose <i>Preaching</i> (as well as from those by whom they were
<i>baptized</i>) they were converted, as by the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th
Verses of Chap. iii. may appear:
<span class="sidenote"><i>That</i> Preaching <i>is a standing Ordinance, and not to be forborne</i>.</span>And yet to remove that Abuse
the Apostle doth not say, He was not sent to preach, nor yet doth
he rejoice that he had only preached to a few; because <i>Preaching</i>,
being a standing Ordinance in the Church, is not, because of any
Abuse that the Devil may tempt any to make of it, to be forborne
by such as are called to perform it by the Spirit of God: Wherefore
the Apostle accordingly, <i>Chap.</i> iii. 8, 9. informs them, as to
that, how to remove that Abuse. But as to Water-baptism, for
that it was no standing Ordinance of Christ, but only practised as in
Condescension to the <i>Jews</i>, and by some Apostles to some <i>Gentiles</i>
also, therefore, so soon as the Apostle perceived the Abuse of it, he
let the <i>Corinthians</i> understand how little Stress was to be laid upon
it, by shewing them that he was glad that he had administered this
Ceremony to so few of them; and by telling them plainly that it
was no Part of his Commission, neither that which he was sent to
administer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>[Pg 374]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Query.</span>Some ask us, <i>How we know that baptizing here is meant of </i>Water<i>, and
not of the </i>Spirit<i>; which if it be, then it will exclude Baptism of the </i>Spirit<i>,
as well as of </i>Water<i>?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, Such as ask the Question, I suppose, speak it not as
doubting that this was said of Water-baptism, which is more than
manifest.
<span class="sidenote"><i>That which converts to </i>Christ<i> is the Baptism of the Spirit.</i></span>For since the Apostle <i>Paul</i>’s Message was, <i>To turn People from
Darkness to Light</i>, and <i>convert them to God</i>; and that as many as are
thus turned and converted, (<i>so as to have the Answer of a good Conscience
toward God, and to have put on Christ, and be risen with him in Newness of
Life</i>) are baptized with the Baptism of the Spirit. But who will say
that only those few mentioned there to be baptized by <i>Paul</i> were
come to this? Or that to turn or bring them to this Condition was
not, even admitting our Adversaries Interpretation, as principal a
Part of <i>Paul</i>’s Ministry as any other? Since then our Adversaries do
take this Place for <i>Water-baptism</i>, as indeed it is, we may lawfully,
taking it so also, urge it upon them. Why the Word <i>Baptism</i> and
<i>Baptizing</i> is used by the Apostle, where that of <i>Water</i> and not of the
<i>Spirit</i> is only understood, shall hereafter be spoken to.
<span class="sidenote">Part 2.</span>I come now
to consider the Reasons alleged by such as plead for <i>Water-baptism</i>,
which are also the Objections used against the Discontinuance
of it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 1.</span><i>First</i>, Some object, <a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a><i>That Christ, who had the Spirit above

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, So was he also <i>circumcised</i>; it will not follow from thence
that <i>Circumcision</i> is to continue:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Why </i>Christ<i> was </i>baptized<i> by </i>John.</span>For it behoved Christ to fulfil all
Righteousness, not only the Ministry of <i>John</i>, but the <i>Law</i> also,
therefore did he observe the <i>Jewish Feasts</i> and <i>Rites</i>, and keep the
<i>Passover</i>. It will not thence follow that <i>Christians</i> ought to do so
now; and therefore Christ, <i>Matt.</i> iii. 15. gives <i>John</i> this Reason of
his being baptized, desiring him to <i>suffer it to be so now</i>; whereby he
sufficiently intimates that he intended not thereby to perpetuate it
as an Ordinance to his Disciples.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a>[Pg 375]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object, <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. 19. <i>Go ye therefore and teach
all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This is the great Objection, and upon which they build the
whole <i>Superstructure</i>; whereunto the first general and sound <i>Answer</i>
is, by granting the whole;
<span class="sidenote"><i>What Baptism </i>Christ<i> doth mean in </i>Mat. 28.</span>but putting them to prove that <i>Water</i> is
here meant, since the Text is silent of it. And though in Reason
it be sufficient upon our Part that we concede the whole expressed
in the Place, but deny that it is by <i>Water</i>, which is an Addition to
the Text, yet I shall premise some Reasons why we do so, and
then consider the Reasons alleged by those that will have <i>Water</i> to
be here understood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 1.</span>The <i>First</i> is a Maxim yielded to by all, <i>That we ought not to go
from the literal Signification of the Text, except some urgent Necessity force
us thereunto</i>.</p>

<p>But no urgent Necessity in this Place forceth us thereunto:</p>

<p>Therefore we ought not to go from it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, That Baptism which Christ commanded his Apostles was
the one Baptism, <i>id est</i>, his own Baptism:</p>

<p>But the one Baptism, which is Christ’s Baptism, is not with <i>Water</i>,
as we have already proved:</p>

<p>Therefore the Baptism commanded by Christ to his Apostles was
not <i>Water-baptism</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, That Baptism which Christ commanded his Apostles was
such, that as many as were therewith baptized did put on Christ:</p>

<p>But this is not true of <i>Water-baptism</i>:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arg. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, The Baptism commanded by Christ to his Apostles was
not <i>John</i>’s Baptism:</p>

<p>But Baptism with Water was <i>John</i>’s Baptism:</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Alle.">Alleg.</span> 1.</span>But <i>First</i>, They allege, <i>That Christ’s Baptism, though a Baptism with
Water, did differ from </i>John<i>’s, because </i>John<i> only baptized with Water unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span>
Repentance, but Christ commands his Disciples to baptize in the Name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; reckoning that in this Form there lieth a great
Difference betwixt the Baptism of </i>John<i> and that of </i>Christ.</p>

<p>I <i>answer</i>, In that <i>John</i>’s Baptism was unto Repentance, the Difference
lieth not there, because so is Christ’s also; yea, our Adversaries
will not deny but that <i>adult Persons</i> that are to be baptized
ought, ere they are admitted to <i>Water-baptism</i>, to repent, and confess
their Sins: And that <i>Infants</i> also, with a Respect to and Consideration
of their Baptism, ought to repent and confess; so that
the Difference lieth not here, since this of Repentance and Confession
agrees as well to <i>Christ</i>’s as to <i>John</i>’s Baptism. But in this our
<i>Adversaries</i> are divided; for <i>Calvin</i> will have <i>Christ</i>’s and <i>John</i>’s to be
all one, <i>Inst. Lib. 4. Cap. 15. Sect. 7, 8.</i> yet they do differ, and the
Difference is, in that the one is by Water, the other not, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, As to what Christ saith, in commanding them to <i>baptize
in the Name of the Father, Son, and Spirit</i>, I confess that states the
Difference, and it is great; but that lies not only in admitting
<i>Water-baptism</i> in this different Form, by a bare Expressing of these
Words: For as the Text says no such Thing, neither do I see how
it can be inferred from it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of the Name of the Lord how taken in Scripture.</i></span>For the Greek is [Greek: eis to onoma: εις το ονομα], that is,
<i>into the Name</i>; now the <i>Name</i> of the <i>Lord</i> is often taken in Scripture
for something else than a bare Sound of Words, or literal Expression,
even for his <i>Virtue</i> and <i>Power</i>, as may appear from <i>Psal.</i> liv. 3.
<i>Cant.</i> i. 3. <i>Prov.</i> xviii. 10. and in many more.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Baptism<i> into the </i>Name<i>, what it is.</i></span>Now that the
Apostles were by their Ministry to baptize the Nations <i>into this Name</i>,
<i>Virtue</i>, and <i>Power</i>, and that they did so, is evident by these Testimonies
of <i>Paul</i> above-mentioned, where he saith, <i>That as many of
them as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</i>; this must have been
a <i>Baptizing into the Name</i>, i. e. <i>Power</i> and <i>Virtue</i>, and not a mere
formal Expression of Words adjoined with Water-baptism; because,
as hath been above observed, it doth not follow as a natural or
necessary Consequence of it. I would have those who desire to
have their Faith built upon no other Foundation than the Testi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>[Pg 377]</span>mony
of <i>God’s Spirit</i>, and <i>Scriptures</i> of <i>Truth</i>, throughly to consider
whether there can be any Thing further alleged for this Interpretation
than what the Prejudice of Education and Influence of Tradition
hath imposed. Perhaps it may stumble the unwary and inconsiderate
<i>Reader</i>, as if the very Character of <i>Christianity</i> were
abolished, to tell him plainly that this Scripture is not to be understood
of <i>baptizing with Water</i>, and that this Form of <i>Baptizing in the
Name of the Father, Son, and Spirit</i>, hath no Warrant from <i>Matt.</i>
xxviii. <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Whether Christ did prescribe a Form of </i>Baptism<i> in </i>Matt. 28.</span>For which, besides the Reason taken from the Signification of
[<i>the Name</i>] as being the <i>Virtue</i> and <i>Power</i> above expressed, let it be
considered, that if it had been a <i>Form</i> prescribed by Christ to his
Apostles, then surely they would have made use of that Form in
the administering of <i>Water-baptism</i> to such as they baptized with
Water; but though particular Mention be made in divers Places of
the <i>Acts</i> who were baptized, and how; and though it be particularly
expressed that they <i>baptized</i> such and such, as <i>Acts</i> ii. 41. and
viii. 12, 13. 38. and ix. 18. and x. 48. and xvi. 15. and xviii. 8.
yet there is not a Word of this Form. And in two Places, <i>Acts</i>
viii. 16. and xix. 5. it is said of some that they were <i>baptized in the
Name of the Lord Jesus</i>; by which it yet more appears, that either the
Author of this <i>History</i> hath been very defective, who having so often
Occasion to mention this, yet omitteth so substantial a Part of <i>Baptism</i>
(which were to accuse the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, by whose Guidance <i>Luke</i>
wrote it) or else that the Apostles did no Ways understand that
<i>Christ</i> by his Commission, <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. did enjoin them such a Form
of <i>Water-baptism</i>, seeing they did not use it. And therefore it is
safer to conclude, that what they did in administering <i>Water-baptism</i>,
they did not by Virtue of that Commission, else they would have so
used it; for our Adversaries I suppose would judge it a great <i>Heresy</i>
to administer <i>Water-baptism</i> without that, or only in the <i>Name of
Jesus</i>, without Mention of <i>Father</i>, or <i>Spirit</i>, as it is expresly said
they did, in the two Places above-cited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>[Pg 378]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alleg. 2.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They say, <i>If this were not understood of </i>Water-baptism,<i> it
would be a Tautology, and all one with </i>Teaching.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I say, <i>Nay: Baptizing with the Spirit</i> is somewhat further than teaching,
or informing the Understanding;
<span class="sidenote"><i>How Teaching and Baptizing differ.</i></span>for it imports a <i>Reaching to</i>,
and <i>melting the Heart</i>, whereby it is <i>turned</i>, as well as the <i>Understanding
informed</i>. Besides, we find often in the Scripture, that
<i>Teaching</i> and <i>Instructing</i> are put together, without any Absurdity,
or needless Tautology; and yet these two have a greater Affinity
than <i>Teaching</i> and <i>Baptizing</i> with the <i>Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alleg. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They say, <i>Baptism in this Place must be understood with </i>Water<i>,
because it is the Action of the Apostles; and so cannot be the Baptism of the
Spirit, which is the Work of Christ, and his Grace; not of Man</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>The Baptism with the </i>Spirit<i> ascribed to godly Men as Instruments.</i></span>
I answer; <i>Baptism with the Spirit</i>, though not wrought without
<i>Christ</i> and his <i>Grace</i>, is instrumentally done by Men fitted of God
for that Purpose; and therefore no Absurdity follows, that <i>Baptism</i>
with the <i>Spirit</i> should be expressed as the Action of the Apostles.
For though it be Christ by his Grace that gives <i>spiritual Gifts</i>, yet
the Apostle, <i>Rom.</i> i. 11. speaks of <span class="smcap">HIS</span> <i>imparting to them spiritual Gifts</i>;
and he tells the <i>Corinthians</i>, that <span class="smcap">HE</span> had <i>begotten them through the Gospel</i>,
1 Cor. iv. 15. And yet to beget People to the <i>Faith</i>, is the Work
of <i>Christ</i> and his <i>Grace</i>, not of Men. To convert the Heart, is properly
the Work of Christ; and yet the Scripture oftentimes ascribes
it to Men, as being the Instruments: And since <i>Paul</i>’s Commission
was, <i>To turn People from Darkness to Light</i> (though that be not done
without <i>Christ</i> co-operating by his Grace) so may also <i>Baptizing with
the Spirit</i> be expressed, as performable by Man as the Instrument,
though the Work of <i>Christ</i>’s <i>Grace</i> be needful to concur thereunto.
So that it is no Absurdity to say, That the Apostles did administer
the <i>Baptism</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Alleg. 4.</span><i>Lastly</i>, They say, <i>That since Christ saith here, that he will be with
his Disciples to the End of the World, therefore </i>Water-baptism<i> must continue
so long</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>If he had been speaking here of Water-baptism, then that might
have been urged; but seeing that is denied, and proved to be
false, nothing from thence can be gathered: He speaking of the
Baptism of the <i>Spirit</i>, which we freely confess doth remain to the
End of the World; yea, so long as Christ’s Presence abideth with
his Children.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 3.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object <i>the constant Practice of the Apostles in the
Primitive Church, who</i>, they say, <i>did always administer </i>Water-baptism<i> to
such as they converted to the Faith of Christ; and hence also they further urge
that of </i>Matt. xxviii.<i> to have been meant of </i>Water<i>; or else the Apostles did
not understand it, because in </i>baptizing<i> they used </i>Water<i>; or that in so doing
they walked without a Commission</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, That it was the <i>constant Practice of the Apostles</i>, is denied;
for we have shewn, in the Example of <i>Paul</i>, that it was not so;
since it were most absurd to judge that he converted only those few,
even of the Church of <i>Corinth</i>, whom he saith he baptized; nor
were it less absurd to think that that was a <i>constant apostolick Practice</i>,
which he, who was not inferior to the chiefest of the Apostles, and
who declares he laboured as much as they all, rejoiceth he was so
little in. But further; the Conclusion inferred from the Apostles
Practice of <i>baptizing with Water</i>, to evince that they understood <i>Matt.</i>
xxviii. of Water-baptism, doth not hold:
<span class="sidenote"><i>How the </i>Apostles<i> baptized.</i></span>For though they baptized
with Water, it will not follow that either they did it by Virtue
of that Commission, or that they mistook that Place; nor can
there be any <i>Medium</i> brought, that will infer such a Conclusion.
As to the other insinuated Absurdity, <i>That they did it without a Commission</i>;
it is none at all: For they might have done it by a <i>Permission</i>,
as being in use before <i>Christ’s Death</i>; and because the People,
nursed up with outward Ceremonies, could not be weaned wholly
from them. And thus they used other Things, as <i>Circumcision</i>, and
<i>legal Purifications</i>, which yet they had no Commission from Christ to
do: To which we shall speak more at Length in the following <i>Proposition</i>,
concerning the <i>Supper</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if from the <i>Sameness</i> of the Word, because Christ bids them
<i>baptize</i>, and they afterwards in the Use of Water are said to <i>baptize</i>,
it be judged probable <i>that they did understand that Commission</i>, Matt.
xxviii. <i>to authorize them to baptize with</i> Water, <i>and accordingly practised
it</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>Although it should be granted, that for a Season they did so far
mistake it, as to judge that <i>Water</i> belonged to that Baptism, (which
however I find no Necessity of granting) yet I see not any great
Absurdity would thence follow. For it is plain they did mistake
that Commission, as to a main Part of it, for a Season; as where
he bids them <i>Go, teach all Nations</i>; since some Time after they judged
it unlawful to teach the <i>Gentiles</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Apostles did scruple the Teaching the </i>Gentiles.</span>yea, <i>Peter</i> himself scrupled it, until
by a Vision constrained thereunto; for which, after he had
done it, he was for a Season (until they were better informed)
judged by the rest of his Brethren. Now, if the Education of the
Apostles as <i>Jews</i>, and their Propensity to adhere and stick to the
<i>Jewish Religion</i>, did so far influence them, that even after Christ’s
<i>Resurrection</i>, and the <i>Pouring forth</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>, they could not receive
nor admit of the Teaching of the <i>Gentiles</i>, though Christ, in his
Commission to them, commanded them to preach to them; what
further Absurdity were it to suppose, that, through the like Mistake,
the chiefest of them having been the Disciples of <i>John</i>, and his Baptism
being so much prized there among the <i>Jews</i>, they also took
Christ’s Baptism, intended by him of the Spirit, to be that of Water,
which was <i>John</i>’s, and accordingly practised it for a Season? It suffices
us, that if they were so mistaken, (though I say not that they
were so) they did not always remain under that Mistake: Else <i>Peter</i>
would not have said of the Baptism which now saves, <i>That it is not
a putting away of the Filth of the Flesh</i>, which certainly Water-baptism
is.</p>

<p>But further, They urge much <i>Peter</i>’s baptizing <i>Cornelius</i>; in which
they press two Things, First, <i>That Water-baptism is used, even to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>[Pg 381]</span>
that had received the Spirit</i>. Secondly, <i>That it is said positively, He commanded
them to be baptized</i>, Acts x. 47, 48.</p>

<p>But neither of these doth necessarily infer Water-baptism to belong
to the <i>New Covenant Dispensation</i>, nor yet to be a perpetual
standing <i>Ordinance</i> in the Church.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whether </i>Peter<i>’s baptizing some with Water makes it a standing Ordinance to the Church.</i></span>For <i>First</i>, All that this will
amount to, was, That <i>Peter</i> at that Time baptized these Men;
but that he did it by Virtue of that Commission, <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. remains
yet to be proved. And how doth the Baptizing with Water,
after the Receiving of the Holy Ghost, prove the Case, more than
the Use of <i>Circumcision</i>, and other <i>legal Rites</i>, acknowledged to have
been performed by him afterwards? Also, it is no Wonder if <i>Peter</i>,
who thought it so strange (notwithstanding all that had been professed
before, and spoken by Christ) that the <i>Gentiles</i> should be made
Partakers of the Gospel, and with great Difficulty, not without an
extraordinary Impulse thereunto, was brought to come to them,
and eat with them, was apt to put this Ceremony upon them;
which being, as it were, the particular Dispensation of <i>John</i>, the
<i>Forerunner</i> of Christ, seemed to have greater Affinity with the Gospel,
than the other <i>Jewish Ceremonies</i> then used by the <i>Church</i>; but
that will no ways infer our Adversaries Conclusion. <i>Secondly</i>, As
to these Words, <i>And he commanded them to be baptized</i>; it declareth
Matter of <i>Fact</i>, not of <i>Right</i>, and amounteth to no more, than that
<i>Peter</i> did at that Time, <i>pro hic &amp; nunc</i>, command those Persons
to be <i>baptized with Water</i>, which is not denied: But it saith nothing
that <i>Peter</i> commanded Water-baptism to be a standing
and perpetual Ordinance to the Church; neither can any Man of
sound Reason say, if he heed what he says, That a Command in
<i>Matter of Fact</i> to particular Persons, doth infer the <i>Thing commanded</i>
to be of general Obligation to all, if it be not otherwise founded
upon some positive Precept. Why doth <i>Peter</i>’s commanding <i>Cornelius</i>
and his Houshold to be baptized at that Time infer <i>Water-baptism</i>
to continue, more than his constraining (which is more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span>
commanding) the <i>Gentiles</i> in General to be <i>circumcised</i>, and observe
the <i>Law</i>? We find at that Time, when <i>Peter</i> baptized <i>Cornelius</i>, it
was not yet determined whether the <i>Gentiles</i> should not be <i>circumcised</i>;
but on the contrary, it was the most general Sense of the
<i>Church</i> that <i>they should</i>: And therefore no Wonder if they thought
it needful at that Time that they should be baptized; which had
more Affinity with the Gospel, and was a Burthen less grievous.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They object <i>from the Signification of the Word </i>[baptize]<i>
which is as much as to </i>dip<i> and </i>wash<i> with </i>Water<i>; alleging thence
that the very Word imports a being baptized with</i> Water.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This Objection is very weak.
<span class="sidenote">Baptizing<i> signifies Dipping or Washing with Water.</i></span>For since <i>baptizing</i> with Water
was a Rite among the <i>Jews</i>, as <i>Paulus Riccius</i> sheweth, even before
the Coming of <i>John</i>; and that the Ceremony received that Name
from the Nature of the Practice, as used both by the <i>Jews</i> and by
<i>John</i>; yet we find that Christ and his Apostles frequently make
use of these Terms to a more spiritual Signification. <i>Circumcision</i>
was only used and understood among the <i>Jews</i> to be <i>that of the
Flesh</i>; but the Apostle tells us of the <i>Circumcision of the Heart and
Spirit made without Hands</i>. So that though Baptism was used among
the <i>Jews</i> only to signify a <i>Washing with Water</i>, yet both <i>John</i>, Christ,
and his Apostles, speak of a being <i>baptized with the Spirit, and with
Fire</i>; which they make the peculiar Baptism of Christ, as contra-distinguished
from that of <i>Water</i>, which was <i>John</i>’s, as is above
shewn. So that though Baptism among the <i>Jews</i> was only understood
of <i>Water</i>, yet among <i>Christians</i> it is very well understood of
the <i>Spirit</i> without <i>Water</i>: As we see Christ and his Apostles spiritually
to understand Things, under the Terms of what had been
<i>Shadows</i> before. Thus Christ, speaking of his <i>Body</i>, (though the
<i>Jews</i> mistook him) said, <i>Destroy this Temple, and in three Days I will
raise it up</i>; and many more that might be instanced. But if the
<i>Etymology</i> of the Word should be tenaciously adhered to, it would

<span class="sidenote">[Greek: Baptizô: Βαπτιζω] <i>immergo</i>, <i>intingo</i>, to plunge and dip in.</span>
For the Greek [Greek: Baptizô: Βαπτιζω] signifies <i>immergo</i>, that is, to <i>plunge</i> and <i>dip
in</i>; and that was the proper Use of Water-baptism among the <i>Jews</i>,
and also by <i>John</i>, and the primitive Christians, who used it;
whereas our Adversaries, for the most Part, only <i>sprinkle</i> a little
Water upon the Forehead, which doth not at all answer to the
Word [<i>Baptism.</i>]
<span class="sidenote"><i>Those that of old used </i>Water-baptism<i> were </i>dipped<i> and </i>plunged<i>, and those that were only </i>sprinkled<i>, were not admitted to any Office in the Church, </i>and why.</span>Yea, those of old among Christians that used
Water-baptism, thought this <i>Dipping</i> or <i>Plunging</i> so needful, that
they thus <i>dipped</i> Children: And forasmuch as it was judged that
it might prove hurtful to some weak Constitutions, <i>Sprinkling</i>, to
prevent that Hurt, was introduced; yet then it was likewise appointed,
that such as were only <i>sprinkled</i>, and not <i>dipped</i>, should
not be admitted to have any Office in the Church, as not being
sufficiently <i>baptized</i>. So that if our Adversaries will stick to the Word,
they must alter their Method of <i>Sprinkling</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 5.</span><i>Fifthly</i>, They object, <i>John</i> iii. 5. <i>Except a Man be born of </i>Water<i>,
and of the </i>Spirit<i>, &amp;c. hence inferring the Necessity of </i>Water-baptism<i>,
as well as of the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But if this prove any Thing, it will prove Water-baptism to be
of absolute Necessity; and therefore <i>Protestants</i> rightly affirm, when
this is urged upon them by <i>Papists</i>, to evince the absolute Necessity
of Water-baptism, that [<i>Water</i>] is not here understood of outward
Water;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Water that regenerates, is mystical and inward</i>.</span>but mystically, of an inward Cleansing and Washing.
Even as where Christ speaks of being <i>baptized with Fire</i>, it is not to
be understood of outward material Fire, but only of purifying, by
a <i>Metonymy</i>; because to <i>purify</i> is a proper Effect of Fire, as to <i>wash</i>
and <i>make clean</i> is of Water; where it can as little be so understood,
as where we are said to be <i>saved by the Washing of Regeneration</i>, Tit.
iii. 5. Yea, <i>Peter</i> saith expresly, in the Place often cited, as <i>Calvin</i>
well observes, <a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a><i>That the </i>Baptism<i> which saves, is not the putting away
of the Filth of the Flesh</i>. So that since [<i>Water</i>] cannot be understood
of outward Water, this can serve nothing to prove Water-baptism.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, That [<i>Water</i>] <i>imports here</i> necessitatem præcepti,
<i>though not</i> medii;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, That is first to take it for granted that outward Water
is here understood; the contrary whereof we have already proved.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Necessitas præcepti </i>and<i> medii </i>urged.</span>Next, <i>Water</i> and the <i>Spirit</i> are placed here together, [<i>Except a Man
be born of </i>Water<i> and the </i>Spirit] where the Necessity of the one is
urged as much as of the other. Now if the Spirit be absolutely necessary,
so will also Water; and then we must either say, that <i>to be
born of the Spirit</i> is not absolutely necessary, which all acknowledge
to be false; or else, that <i>Water</i> is absolutely necessary; which, as
<i>Protestants</i>, we affirm, and have proved, is false: Else we must confess,
that <i>Water</i> is not here understood of outward Water. For to
say that when <i>Water</i> and the <i>Spirit</i> are placed here just together,
and in the same Manner, though there be not any Difference or
Ground for it visible in the Text, or deducible from it, That the
<i>Necessity</i> of <i>Water</i> is here <i>præcepti</i>, but not <i>medii</i>, but the <i>Necessity</i> of
the <i>Spirit</i> is both <i>medii</i> and <i>præcepti</i>, is indeed confidently to affirm,
but not to prove.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Obj. 6.</span><i>Sixthly</i> and <i>lastly</i>, They object, <i>That the Baptism of Water is a visible
Sign or Badge to distinguish </i>Christians<i> from </i>Infidels,<i> even as Circumcision
did the </i>Jews.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, This saith nothing at all, unless it be proved to be a
<i>necessary Precept</i>, or Part of the <i>New Covenant Dispensation</i>; it not being
lawful for us to impose outward <i>Ceremonies</i> and <i>Rites</i>, and say,
They will distinguish us from <i>Infidels</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Circumcision a Seal of the first Covenant.</i></span><i>Circumcision</i> was positively commanded,
and said to be a <i>Seal of the first Covenant</i>; but as we have
already proved that there is no such Command for Baptism,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Water-baptism falsely called a</i> Badge <i>of Christianity.</i></span>so there is not any Word in all the New Testament, calling it a <i>Badge
of Christianity</i>, or <i>Seal of the New Covenant</i>: And therefore to conclude
it is so, because <i>Circumcision</i> was so, (unless some better Proof be
alleged for it) is miserably to beg the Question.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Which is the </i>Badge<i> of Christianity.</i></span><i>The Professing of
Faith in Christ, and a holy Life answering thereunto, is a far better </i>Badge<i>
of </i>Christianity<i> than any outward Washing</i>; which yet answers not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>[Pg 385]</span>
that of <i>Circumcision</i>, since that affixed a Character in the Flesh, which
this doth not: So that a Christian is not known to be a Christian
by his being <i>baptized</i>, especially when he was a Child, unless he
tell them so much:
<span class="sidenote"><i>What the </i>Fathers<i> say of Water-baptism, and of the Sign of the Cross.</i></span>And may not the Professing of <i>Faith in Christ</i>
signify that as well? I know there are divers of those called the <i>Fathers</i>,
that speak much of Water-baptism, calling it <i>Characterem Christianitatis</i>:
But so did they also of the Sign of the <i>Cross</i>, and other
such Things, justly rejected by <i>Protestants</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Heathenish<i> Ceremonies introduced into the Christian Worship.</i></span>For the <i>Mystery of Iniquity</i>,
which began to work in the Apostles Days, soon spoiled the Simplicity
and Purity of the Christian Worship; insomuch that not
only many <i>Jewish Rites</i> were retained, but many <i>Heathenish Customs</i>
and <i>Ceremonies</i> introduced into the Christian Worship; as particularly
that Word [<i>Sacrament</i>.] So that it is a great Folly, especially
for <i>Protestants</i>, to plead any Thing of this from <i>Tradition</i> or <i>Antiquity</i>;
For we find that neither <i>Papists</i> nor <i>Protestants</i> use those Rites exactly
as the <i>Ancients</i> did; who in such Things, not walking by the
most certain Rule of God’s Spirit, but doting too much upon Externals,
were very uncertain. For most of them all, in the primitive
Times, did wholly <i>plunge</i> and <i>dip</i> those they baptized, which
neither <i>Papists</i>, nor most <i>Protestants</i>, do: Yea, several of the <i>Fathers</i>
accused some as <i>Hereticks</i> in their Days, for holding some Principles
common with <i>Protestants</i> concerning it; as particularly <i>Augustine</i>
doth the <i>Pelagians</i>, for saying that <i>Infants dying unbaptized may be saved</i>.
And the <i>Manichees</i> were condemned, for denying that <i>Grace is Universally
given by Baptism</i>; and <i>Julian</i> the <i>Pelagian</i> by <i>Augustine</i>, for denying
<i>Exorcism and Insufflation in the Use of Baptism</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Exorcism or Adjuration.</i></span>All which Things
<i>Protestants</i> deny also. So that <i>Protestants</i> do but foolishly to upbraid
us, as if we could not shew any among the <i>Ancients</i> that denied
<i>Water-baptism</i>; seeing they cannot shew any, whom they acknowledge
not to have been heretical in several Things, that used it;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Sign of the Cross.</i></span>nor yet, who using it, did not also use the <i>Sign of the Cross</i>, and other
Things with it, which they deny.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Many in </i>former Ages<i> testified against </i>Water-baptism.</span>There were some nevertheless in
the darkest Times of <i>Popery</i>, who testified against <i>Water-baptism</i>. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>[Pg 386]</span>
one <i>Alanus</i>, Page 103, 104. 107. speaks of some in his Time that were
burnt for the denying of it: For they said, That <i>Baptism had no Efficacy,
either in Children or adult Persons; and therefore Men were not
obliged to take Baptism: </i>Particularly<i> ten Canonicks</i>, so called, <i>were burnt
for that Crime, by the Order of King </i>Robert<i> of </i>France. And <span class="correction" title="In the original book: P. Pithæus"><i>P. Pithœus</i></span>
mentions it in his <i>Fragments</i> of the <i>History</i> of <i>Guienne</i>, which is
also confirmed by one <i>Johannes Floracensis</i>, a <i>Monk</i>, who was famous
at that Time, in his Epistle to <i>Oliva</i>, Abbot of the <i>Ausonian</i> Church:
“I will, saith he, give you to understand concerning the Heresy
that was in the City of <i>Orleans</i> on <i>Childermas-day</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Ten Canonicks burnt at </i>Orleans<i>, and why.</i></span>for it was true,
if ye have heard any Thing, that King <i>Robert</i> caused to be burnt
alive near fourteen of that City, of the chief of their <i>Clergy</i>, and
the more noble of their <i>Laicks</i>, who were hateful to God, and
abominable to Heaven and Earth; for they did stifly deny the
Grace of holy Baptism, and also the Consecration of the Lord’s
Body and Blood.” The Time of this Deed is noted in these Words
by <i>Papir. Masson</i>, in his <i>Annals</i> of <i>France</i>, Lib. 3. in <i>Hugh</i> and <i>Robert</i>,
<i>Actum Aureliæ publicè anno Incarnationis Domini 1022. Regni </i>Roberti<i> Regis
28, Indictione 5. quando </i>Stephanus<i> Hæresiarcha &amp; Complices ejus damnati
sunt et exusti Aureliæ</i>.</p>

<p>Now for their calling them <i>Hereticks</i> and <i>Manichees</i>, we have nothing
but the Testimony of their Accusers, which will no more invalidate
their Testimony for this Truth against the Use of Water-baptism,
or give more Ground to charge us, as being one with <i>Manichees</i>,
than because some, called by them <i>Manichees</i>, do agree with
<i>Protestants</i> in some Things, that therefore <i>Protestants</i> are <i>Manichees</i> or
<i>Hereticks</i>, which <i>Protestants</i> can no Ways shun. For the Question is,
Whether, in what they did, they walked according to the Truth
testified of by the Spirit in the Holy Scriptures? So that the Controversy
is brought back again to the Scriptures, according to which,
I suppose, I have already discussed it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Baptism<i> of </i>Infants<i> an Human Tradition.</i></span>As for the latter Part of the <i>Thesis</i>, denying the Use of <i>Infant-baptism</i>,
it necessarily follows from what is above said. For if Water-baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>[Pg 387]</span>
be ceased, then surely <i>Baptizing of Infants</i> is not warrantable.
But those that take upon them to oppose us in this Matter, will
have more to do as to this latter Part: For after they have done
what they can to prove Water-baptism, it remains for them to prove
that <i>Infants</i> ought to be baptized. For he that proves Water-baptism
ceased, proves that Infant-baptism is vain: But he that should
prove that Water-baptism continues, has not thence proved that
Infant-baptism is necessary; that needs something further. And
therefore it was a pitiful Subterfuge of <i>Nic. Arnoldus</i> against this,
to say, That <i>the Denying of Infant-baptism belonged to the Gangrene of the</i>
Anabaptists, without adding any further Proof.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> The <i>Communion</i> of the Body and Blood of Christ is a <i>Mystery</i>
hid from all natural Men, in their first fallen and
degenerate State, which they cannot understand, reach to, nor comprehend,
as they there abide; neither, as they there are, can they
be Partakers of it, nor yet are they able to <i>discern the Lord’s Body</i>.
And forasmuch as the <i>Christian World</i> (so called) for the most Part
hath been still labouring, working, conceiving and imagining, in
their own natural and unrenewed Understandings, about the Things
of God and Religion; therefore hath this <i>Mystery</i> been much hid
and sealed up from them, while they have been contending, quarrelling
and fighting one with another about the mere Shadow,
Outside, and Form, but Strangers to the Substance, Life and Virtue.</div>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Body<i> and </i>Blood<i> of Christ is spiritual.</i></span>The <i>Body</i> then of Christ, which Believers partake of, is <i>spiritual</i>,
and not <i>carnal</i>; and his <i>Blood</i>, which they drink of, is <i>pure</i>
and <i>heavenly</i>, and not <i>human</i> or <i>elementary</i>, as <i>Augustine</i> also affirms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span>
of the <i>Body of Christ</i>, which is eaten, in his <i>Tractat.</i> Psal. xcviii. <i>Except
a Man eat my Flesh, he hath not in him Life eternal</i>: And he saith,
<i>The Words which I speak unto you are Spirit and Life; understand spiritually
what I have spoken. Ye shall not eat of this Body which ye see, and drink
this Blood which they shall spill, who crucify me&mdash;I am the living Bread,
who have descended from Heaven. He calls himself the Bread, who descended
from Heaven, exhorting that we might believe in him</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be asked then, <i>What that </i>Body<i>, what that </i>Flesh<i> and </i>Blood<i> is?</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, It is that <i>Heavenly Seed</i>, that <i>divine, spiritual, celestial Substance</i>,
of which we spake before in the <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth Propositions</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What the </i>heavenly Seed<i> is, whereby formerly, and also now, </i>Life<i> and </i>Salvation<i> was and is communicated.</i></span>This is that <i>spiritual Body of Christ</i>, whereby and through which he
communicateth <i>Life to Men</i>, and <i>Salvation to as many as believe in him</i>,
and <i>receive him</i>; and whereby also Man comes to have Fellowship
and Communion with God. This is proved from the 6th of <i>John</i>,
from Verse 32. to the End, where Christ speaks more at large of this
Matter, than in any other Place: And indeed this <i>Evangelist</i> and
<i>beloved Disciple</i>, who lay in the Bosom of our Lord, gives us a more
full Account of the <i>spiritual Sayings</i> and <i>Doctrine</i> of Christ than any
other; and it is observable, that though he speaks nothing of the
<i>Ceremony</i> used by Christ of <i>breaking Bread with his Disciples</i>, neither in
his evangelical Account of Christ’s <i>Life and Sufferings</i>, nor in his
Epistles; yet he is more large in this Account of the <i>Participation</i> of
the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, than any of them all. For
Christ, in this Chapter, perceiving that the <i>Jews</i> did follow him
for Love of the <i>Loaves</i>, desires them (Verse 27) to <i>labour not for the
Meat which perisheth, but for that Meat which endureth for ever</i>: But forasmuch
as they, being carnal in their Apprehensions, and not understanding
the spiritual Language and Doctrine of Christ, did judge
the <i>Manna</i>, which <i>Moses</i> gave their Fathers, to be the most excellent
Bread, as coming from Heaven; Christ, to rectify that Mistake,
and better inform them, affirmeth, <i>First</i>, That <i>it is not Moses, but
his </i>Father<i>, that giveth the true </i>Bread<i> from Heaven</i>, Ver. 32. and 48.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span>
<i>Secondly</i>, This Bread <i>he calls</i> himself, Ver. 35. I <i>am the </i>Bread<i> of
Life</i>: And Ver. 51. I<i> am the </i>living Bread,<i> which came down from Heaven</i>.
<i>Thirdly</i>, He declares that this Bread is his Flesh, Ver. 51. The
Bread <i>that I will give, is my Flesh</i>; and Ver. 55. <i>For my Flesh is Meat
indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.</i> <i>Fourthly</i>, The Necessity of partaking
thereof. Ver. 53. <i>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and
drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</i> And <i>Lastly</i>, The blessed Fruits
and necessary Effects of this Communion of the Body and Blood of
Christ. Ver. 33. <i>This </i>Bread<i> giveth Life to the World.</i> Ver. 50. <i>He
that eateth thereof, dieth not.</i> Ver. 58. <i>He that eateth of this </i>Bread<i>, shall
live for ever.</i> Ver. 54. <i>Whoso eateth this Flesh, and drinketh this Blood, shall
live for ever.</i> Ver. 56. <i>And he dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him.</i> Ver. 57. <i>And shall live by Christ.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Origin, Nature and Effects of the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ.</i></span>From this large Description of the Origin, Nature, and Effects of this <i>Body</i>, <i>Flesh</i> and <i>Blood of</i> Christ, it is
apparent that it is spiritual, and to be understood of a spiritual
Body, and not of that Body, or Temple of Jesus Christ, which
was born of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, and in which he walked, lived, and
suffered in the Land of <i>Judea</i>; because it is said, that it <i>came down
from Heaven</i>, yea, that it is he that <i>came down from Heaven</i>. Now all
Christians at present generally acknowledge, that the outward Body
of Christ came not down from Heaven; neither was it that Part of
Christ which came down from Heaven. And to put the Matter out
of Doubt, when the carnal <i>Jews</i> would have been so understanding
it, he tells them plainly, Ver. 63. <i>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the Flesh profiteth Nothing.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Solid Reasons that it is his spiritual Body Christ speaks of.</i></span>This is also founded upon most sound and solid Reason; because it is the Soul, not the Body, that is to
be nourished by this Flesh and Blood. Now outward Flesh cannot
nourish nor feed the Soul; there is no Proportion nor Analogy betwixt
them; neither is the Communion of the Saints with God by
a Conjunction and mutual Participation of Flesh, but of the Spirit:
<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a><i>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit, </i>not<i> one Flesh</i>. For the Flesh
(I mean outward Flesh, even such as was that wherein Christ lived
and walked when upon Earth; and not Flesh, when transformed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
a <i>Metaphor</i>, to be understood spiritually) can only partake of Flesh,
as Spirit of Spirit: As the Body cannot feed upon Spirit, neither
can the Spirit feed upon Flesh. And that the Flesh here spoken of
is spiritually to be understood, appears further, inasmuch as that
which feedeth upon it shall never die: But the Bodies of all Men
once die; yea, it was necessary that the Body of Christ himself
should die. That this Body, and spiritual Flesh and Blood of
Christ, is to be understood of that <i>divine</i> and <i>heavenly Seed</i>, before
spoken of by us, appears both by the Nature and Fruits of it.
<i>First</i>, it is said, <i>It is that which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth
Life unto the World</i>: Now this answers to that <i>Light</i> and <i>Seed</i>, which
is testified of, <i>John</i> i. to be the <i>Light of the World, and the Life of Men</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>This spiritual Light and Seed is as Bread to the hungry Soul.</i></span>For that <i>spiritual Light</i> and <i>Seed</i>, as it receives Place in Men’s Hearts,
and Room to spring up there, is as Bread to the hungry and
fainting Soul, that is (as it were) buried and dead in the Lusts of
the World; which receives Life again, and revives, as it tasteth
and partaketh of this heavenly Bread: And they that partake of it
are said to come to Christ; neither can any have it, but by coming
to him, and believing in the Appearance of his <i>Light</i> in their
Hearts; by receiving which, and believing in it, the Participation
of this Body and Bread is known. And that Christ understands the
same Thing here by his Body, Flesh and Blood, which is understood,
<i>John</i> i. by the <i>Light enlightening every Man</i>, and the <i>Life</i>, &amp;c.
appears; for the <i>Light</i> and <i>Life</i>, spoken of <i>John</i> i. is said to be
<i>Christ</i>; <i>He is the true Light</i>: And the <i>Bread</i> and <i>Flesh</i>, &amp;c. spoken of
in <i>John</i> vi. is called <i>Christ</i>; I <i>am the</i> Bread <i>of Life</i>, saith he. Again,
<i>They that received that Light and Life</i>, John i. 12. <i>obtained Power to become
the Sons of God, by believing in his Name</i>: So also here, <i>John</i> vi. 35.
<i>He that cometh unto this </i>Bread<i> of Life shall not hunger; and he that believes
in him, who is this </i>Bread<i>, shall never thirst</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s outward and spiritual Body distinguished.</i></span>So then, as there was the outward visible Body and Temple of Jesus Christ, which took its
Origin from the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; there is also the spiritual Body of
Christ, by and through which He that was the <i>Word in the Beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span>
with God</i>, and was and is GOD, did reveal himself to the Sons of
Men in all Ages, and whereby Men in all Ages come to be made
Partakers of <i>eternal Life</i>, and to have Communion and Fellowship with God and Christ.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Patriarchs did eat of the Body of Christ</i>.</span>Of which Body of Christ, and Flesh and Blood, if both <i>Adam</i>, and <i>Seth</i>, and <i>Enoch</i>, and <i>Noah</i>, and <i>Abraham</i>, and <i>Moses</i>,
and <i>David</i>, and all the Prophets and holy Men of God, had not eaten,
they had not had Life in them; nor could their inward Man have
been nourished. Now as the outward Body and Temple was called
Christ, so was also his spiritual Body, no less properly, and that
long before that outward Body was in Being. Hence the Apostle
saith, 1 <i>Cor.</i> x. 3, 4. That the <i>Fathers did all eat the same spiritual Meat,
and did all drink the same spiritual Drink</i>: [<i>For they drank of that spiritual
Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</i>] This cannot be understood
otherwise than of this spiritual Body of Christ; which spiritual
Body of Christ, though it was the saving Food of the Righteous
both before the <i>Law</i> and under the <i>Law</i>; yet under the <i>Law</i> it
was veiled and shadowed, and covered under divers Types, Ceremonies
and Observations; yea, and not only so, but it was veiled
and hid, in some Respect, under the outward Temple and Body of
Christ, or during the Continuance of it; so that the <i>Jews</i> could not
understand Christ’s Preaching about it while on Earth: <a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>And not
the <i>Jews</i> only, but many of his Disciples, judging it an <i>hard Saying,
murmured at it</i>; <i>and many from that Time went back from him, and walked no
more with him</i>. I doubt not but that there are many also at this Day,
professing to be the Disciples of Christ, that do as little understand
this Matter as those did, and are as apt to be offended, and stumble
at it, while they are gazing and following after the outward Body;
and look not to that by which the Saints are daily fed and nourished.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The divine Light of Christ doth make the Saints Partakers of his Body.</i></span>For as Jesus Christ, in Obedience to the Will of the Father,
did by the <i>eternal Spirit offer up that </i>Body<i> for a Propitiation </i>for

Believer, or really feelest, by a certain and sad Experience, that
thou art yet in the Unbelief, and findest that the outward Body and
Flesh of Christ is so far from thee, that thou canst not reach it, nor
feed upon it; yea, though thou hast often swallowed down and
taken in that which the <i>Papists</i> have persuaded thee to be the real
Flesh and Blood of Christ, and hast believed it to be so, though all
thy Senses told thee the Contrary;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Lutherans<i> and </i>Calvinists<i> Opinions of the Flesh and Blood of Christ in the </i>Supper<i> so called.</i></span>or (being a <i>Lutheran</i>) hast taken
that Bread, in and with and under which the <i>Lutherans</i> have assured
thee that the Flesh and Blood of Christ is; or (being a <i>Calvinist</i>) hast
partaken of that which the <i>Calvinists</i> say (though a Figure only of
the Body) gives them who take it a real Participation of the Body,
Flesh, and Blood of Christ, though they never knew how nor what
Way; I say, if for all this thou findest thy Soul yet barren, yea,
hungry, and ready to starve, for want of something thou longest
for; <i>know</i> that that <i>Light</i> which discovers thy Iniquity to thee, which
shews thee thy Barrenness, thy Nakedness, thy Emptiness, is that
<i>Body</i> which thou must partake of, and feed upon: But that till
by forsaking Iniquity thou turnest to it, comest unto it, receivest
it, though thou mayest hunger after it, thou canst not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>[Pg 394]</span>
satisfied with it; <a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>for it hath no <i>Communion with Darkness, nor canst thou
drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils: And be Partaker of
the Lord’s Table, and the Table of Devils</i>, 1 Cor. x. 21.
<span class="sidenote"><i>How the inward Man is nourished.</i></span>But as thou
sufferest that small <i>Seed of Righteousness</i> to arise in thee, and to be
formed into a Birth, that new substantial Birth, which is brought forth
in the Soul, supernaturally feeds upon and is nourished by this spiritual
Body; yea, as this outward Birth lives not but as it draws in
Breath by the outward elementary Air, so this new Birth lives not in
the Soul, but as it draws in and breathes by that spiritual Air or Vehicle.
And as the outward Birth cannot subsist without some outward Body
to feed upon, some outward Flesh, and some outward Drink, so neither
can this inward Birth, unless it be fed by this inward Flesh and
Blood of Christ, which answers to it after the same Manner, by
Way of Analogy. And this is most agreeable to the Doctrine of
Christ concerning this Matter. For as without outward Food the
natural Body hath not Life, so also saith Christ, <a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a><i>Except ye eat the
Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you</i>. And
as the outward Body, eating outward Food, lives thereby, so Christ
saith, <a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>That <i>he that eateth him shall live by him</i>. So it is this inward
Participation of this <i>inward Man</i>, of this <i>inward</i> and <i>spiritual Body</i>,
by which Man is united to God, and has Fellowship and Communion
with him. <a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><i>He that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood</i>, saith
Christ, <i>dwelleth in me, and I in him</i>. This cannot be understood of
outward eating of outward Bread; and as by this the Soul must
have Fellowship with God, so also, so far as all the Saints are Partakers
of this <i>one Body</i> and <i>one Blood</i>, they come also to have a <i>joint
Communion</i>. Hence the Apostle, 1 <i>Cor.</i> x. 17. in this Respect saith,
That they <a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a><i>being many, are one </i>Bread,<i> and one </i>Body; and to the Wise
among the <i>Corinthians</i> he saith,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The true spiritual Supper of the Lord.</i></span><i>The </i>Bread<i> which we break is the Communion
of the Body of Christ</i>. This is the <i>true</i> and <i>spiritual Supper</i> of the
Lord, which Men come to partake of, by hearing the Voice of
Christ, and opening the Door of their Hearts, and so letting him
in in the Manner abovesaid, according to the plain Words of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a>[Pg 395]</span>
Scripture, <i>Rev.</i> iii. 20. <i>Behold I stand at the Door and knock; if any Man
hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
him, and he with me</i>. So that the <i>Supper of the Lord</i>, and the <i>supping</i>
with the Lord, and partaking of his Flesh and Blood, is no Ways
limited to the Ceremony of <i>breaking Bread</i> and <i>drinking Wine</i> at particular
Times, but is truly and really enjoyed, as often as the Soul
retires into the Light of the Lord, and feels and partakes of that
heavenly Life by which the inward Man is nourished; which may
be and is often witnessed by the Faithful at all Times, though
more particularly when they are assembled together to wait upon
the Lord.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> But what Confusion the Professors of Christianity have
run into concerning this Matter, is more than obvious; who, as
in most other Things they have done, for want of a true spiritual
Understanding, have sought to tie this <i>Supper</i> of the Lord to that
Ceremony used by Christ before his Death, of <i>breaking Bread</i> and
<i>drinking Wine</i> with his Disciples.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Man is not tied to the Ceremony of </i>breaking Bread<i> and </i>drinking Wine<i> which Christ did use with his Disciples, this only was a Shadow.</i></span>And though they for the most
Part agree generally in this, yet how do they contend and debate
one against another! How strangely are they pinched, pained,
and straitened to make the spiritual Mystery agree to that Ceremony!
And what monstrous and wild Opinions and Conceptions
have they invented, to inclose or affix the Body of Christ to their
<i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>? From which Opinion not only the greatest, and
fiercest, and most hurtful Contests, both among the Professors of
Christianity in general, and among <i>Protestants</i> in particular, have
arisen;
<span class="sidenote"><i>What makes the Christian Religion hateful to the </i>Jews<i>, </i>Turks<i>, and </i>Heathens.</span>but also such Absurdities, irrational and blasphemous Consequences
have ensued, as make the Christian Religion odious and
hateful to <i>Jews</i>, <i>Turks</i>, and <i>Heathens</i>. The Professors of Christianity
do chiefly divide in this Matter into three Opinions.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Papists<i> Faith of Christ’s Flesh.</i></span>The <i>First</i> is of those that say, <i>The Substance of the Bread is transubstantiated
into the very Substance of that same Body, Flesh, and Blood of
</i>Christ,<i> which was born of the Virgin </i>Mary,<i> and crucified by the </i>Jews; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>[Pg 396]</span>
that after the <i>Words of Consecration</i>, as they call them, <i>it is no more
Bread, but the Body of</i> Christ.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Lutherans<i> Faith.</i></span>The <i>Second</i> is of such who say, <i>The Substance of the Bread remains,
but that also that Body is in, and with, and under the Bread</i>; so that
<i>both the Substance of Bread, and of the Body, Flesh, and Blood of </i>Christ<i>,
is there also</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Calvinists<i> Faith.</i></span>The <i>Third</i> is of those, that, denying both these, do affirm, <i>That
the Body of </i>Christ<i> is not there corporally or substantially, but yet that it is
really and sacramentally received by the Faithful in the Use of Bread and
Wine</i>; but how or what Way it is there, <i>they know not, nor can
they tell; only we must believe it is there, yet so that it is only properly in
Heaven</i>.</p>

<p>It is not my Design to enter into a Refutation of these several
Opinions; for each of their Authors and Assertors have sufficiently
refuted one another, and are all of them no less strong both from
Scripture and Reason in refuting each their contrary Parties Opinion,
than they are weak in establishing their own. For I often
have seriously observed, in reading their respective Writings, and
so it may be have others, that all of them do notably, in so far as
they refute the contrary Opinions; but that they are mightily
pained, when they come to confirm and plead for their own. Hence
I necessarily must conclude, that none of them had attained to the
Truth and Substance of this <i>Mystery</i>. Let us see if <i>Calvin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> after he
had refuted the two former Opinions, be more successful in what
he affirms and asserts for the Truth of his Opinion, who, after he
hath much laboured in overturning and refuting the two former
Opinions, plainly confesseth, that he knows not what to affirm instead
of them.
<span class="sidenote">J. Calvin<i>’s faith of Christ’s Flesh and Blood uncertain.</i></span>For after he has spoken much, and at last concluded,
<i>That the Body of Christ is there, and that the Saints must needs partake
thereof</i>, at last he lands in these Words, <i>Sect. 32</i>. “But if it be
asked me how it is? I shall not be ashamed to confess, that it is a
Secret too high for me to comprehend in my Spirit, or explain in
Words.” Here he deals very ingenuously; and yet who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>[Pg 397]</span>
have thought that such a Man would have been brought to this
Streight in the Confirming of his Opinion? considering that a little
before, in the same Chapter, <i>Sect. 15.</i> he accuseth the School-men
among the <i>Papists</i>, and I confess truly,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The like the </i>Papists.</span><i>In that they neither understand
nor explain to others how Christ is in the Eucharist</i>, which shortly
after he confesseth himself he cannot do. If then the School-men
among the <i>Papists</i> do neither understand nor yet explain to others
their Doctrine in this Matter, nor <i>Calvin</i> can comprehend it in his
Spirit, which I judge is as much as not to understand it, nor express
it in Words, and then surely he cannot explain it to others,
then no Certainty is to be had from either of them. There have
been great Endeavours used for Reconcilement in this Matter, both
betwixt <i>Papists</i> and <i>Lutherans</i>, <i>Lutherans</i> and <i>Calvinists</i>, yea, and <i>Calvinists</i>
and <i>Papists</i>, but all to no Purpose; and many Forms and
Manners of Expressions drawn up, to which all might yield; which
in the End proved in vain, seeing every one understood them, and
interpreted them in their own Way; and so they did thereby but
equivocate and deceive one another. The Reason of all this Contention
is, because they had not a clear Understanding of the <i>Mystery</i>,
and were doting about <i>Shadows</i> and <i>Externals</i>. For both the Ground
and Matter of their <i>Contest</i> lies in Things extrinsick from, and unnecessary
to, the main Matter.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Satan busies People in </i>outward Signs<i>, </i>Shadows<i>, and </i>Forms<i>, whilst they neglect the </i>Substance.</span>And this hath been often the Policy
of <i>Satan</i>, to busy People, and amuse them with outward Signs,
Shadows, and Forms, making them contend about that, while in
the mean Time the <i>Substance</i> is neglected; yea, and in contending
for these Shadows he stirs them up to the Practice of Malice, Heat,
Revenge, and other Vices, by which he establisheth his Kingdom of
Darkness among them, and ruins the Life of Christianity. For
there have been more Animosities and Heats about this one Particular,
and more Bloodshed and Contention, than about any other.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What hath been hurtful to the</i> Reformation.</span>And surely they are little acquainted with the State of <i>Protestant Affairs</i>,
who know not that their Contentions about this have been
more hurtful to the <i>Reformation</i> than all the Opposition they met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>[Pg 398]</span>
with from their common Adversaries.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Two </i>Errors<i> the Ground of the Contention about the </i>Supper.</span>Now all those uncertain
and absurd Opinions, and the Contentions therefrom arising, have
proceeded from their all agreeing in two general Errors concerning
this Thing; which being denied and receded from, as they are by
us, there would be an easy Way made for <i>Reconciliation</i>, and we
should all meet in one spiritual and true Understanding of this
<i>Mystery</i>: And as the Contentions, so would also the Absurdities
which follow from all the three fore-mentioned Opinions, cease and
fall to the Ground.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> Inst. Lib. 4. Cap. 17.</p></div>

<p>The <i>First</i> of these <i>Errors</i> is, In making the Communion or Participation
of the Body, Flesh, and Blood of Christ to relate to that
outward Body, Vessel, or Temple, that was born of the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, and walked and suffered in <i>Judea</i>; whereas it should relate
to the Spiritual Body, Flesh, and Blood of Christ, even that <i>heavenly</i>
and <i>celestial Light</i> and <i>Life</i>, which was the Food and Nourishment
of the Regenerate in all Ages, as we have already proved.</p>

<p>The <i>Second Error</i> is, In tying this Participation of the Body and
Blood of Christ to that Ceremony used by him with his Disciples
in the Breaking of Bread, <i>&amp;c.</i> as if it had only a Relation thereto,
or were only enjoyed in the Use of that Ceremony, which it neither
hath nor is. For this is that Bread which Christ in his Prayer
teaches to call for, terming it [Greek: ton arton ton epiousion: τον αρτον τον επιουσιον], i. e. the <i>Super-substantial
Bread</i>, as the Greek hath it, and which the Soul partakes
of, without any Relation or necessary Respect to this Ceremony, as
shall be hereafter proved more at Length.</p>

<p>These <i>two Errors</i> being thus laid aside, and the Contentions arising
therefrom buried, all are agreed in the main Positions, <i>viz.</i> <i>First</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Believers Souls <i>do really feed upon the Flesh and Blood of</i> Christ.</span>That the <i>Body, Flesh, and Blood of Christ is necessary for the nourishing of
the Soul</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, That the <i>Souls of Believers do really and truly partake
and feed upon the Body, Flesh, and Blood of Christ</i>. But while Men
are not content with the Spirituality of this <i>Mystery</i>, going in their
own Wills, and according to their own Inventions, to strain and
wrest the Scriptures to tie this spiritual Communion of the Flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span>
and Blood of Christ to outward Bread and Wine, and such like
carnal Ordinances, no Wonder if by their carnal Apprehensions
they run into Confusion. But because it hath been generally supposed
that the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ had
some special Relation to the Ceremony of <i>breaking Bread</i>, I shall
first refute that Opinion, and then proceed to consider the Nature
and Use of that <i>Ceremony</i>, and whether it be now <i>necessary</i> to continue;
answering the Reasons and Objections of such as plead
its Continuance as a necessary and standing Ordinance of Jesus
Christ.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">I.</span><i>First</i>, It must be understood that I speak of a necessary and
peculiar Relation otherwise than in a general Respect: For inasmuch
as our Communion with Christ is and ought to be our greatest and
chiefest Work, we ought to do all other Things with a Respect to
God, and our Fellowship with him;
<span class="sidenote"><i>That the Communion of the </i>Body<i> and </i>Blood<i> of </i>Christ<i> has no special Relation to the Ceremony of </i>breaking Bread<i>, neither by Nature nor Precept.</i></span>but a special and necessary
Respect or Relation is such as where the two Things are so tied and
united together, either <i>of their own Nature</i>, or <i>by the Command of God</i>,
that the one cannot be enjoyed, or at least is not, except very extraordinarily,
without the other. Thus <i>Salvation</i> hath a necessary Respect
to <i>Holiness</i>, because <i>without Holiness no Man shall see God</i>; and the
<i>Eating of the Flesh and Blood of</i> Christ hath a necessary Respect to our
having Life, because if we <i>eat not his Flesh, and drink not his Blood</i>, we
cannot have <i>Life</i>; and our <i>feeling of God’s Presence</i> hath a necessary
Respect to our being found meeting in his Name by divine Precept,
because he has promised, <i>Where two or three are met together in his Name,
he will be in the Midst of them</i>. In like Manner our receiving <i>Benefits</i>
and <i>Blessings from God</i> has a necessary Respect to our <i>Prayer</i>, because
if <i>we ask</i>, he hath promised <i>we shall receive</i>. Now the Communion
or Participation of the <i>Flesh and Blood of Christ</i> hath no such necessary
Relation to the <i>breaking of Bread</i> and <i>drinking of Wine</i>; for if
it had any such necessary Relation, it would either be from the <i>Nature
of the Thing</i>, or from some <i>divine Precept</i>; but we shall shew it is
from neither: Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a>[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, It is not from the <i>Nature of it</i>; because to partake of the
Flesh and Blood of Christ is a spiritual Exercise, and all confess
that it is by the Soul and Spirit that we become real Partakers of it,
as it is the Soul, and not the Body, that is nourished by it. But
to eat Bread and drink Wine is a natural Act, which in itself adds
nothing to the Soul, neither has any Thing that is spiritual in it;
because the most carnal Man that is can as fully, as perfectly, and
as wholly eat Bread and drink Wine as the most spiritual. <i>Secondly</i>,
Their Relation is not <i>by Nature</i>, else they would infer one another;
but all acknowledge that many eat of the Bread and drink of the
Wine, even that which they say is <i>consecrate</i> and <i>transubstantiate into
the very Body of Christ</i>, who notwithstanding have not Life eternal,
have not Christ dwelling in them, nor do live by him, as all do
who truly partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ without the Use
of this Ceremony, as all the <i>Patriarchs</i> and <i>Prophets</i> did before this
Ordinance, as they account it, was instituted.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Patriarchs and Prophets, without this Ceremony’s Use, were true Partakers of Christ’s Flesh and Blood.</i></span>Neither was there
any Thing under the Law that had any direct or necessary Relation
hereunto; though to partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ in all
Ages was indispensably necessary to Salvation.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Paschal </i>Lamb<i> its End.</i></span>For as for the <i>Paschal
Lamb</i>, the whole End of it is signified particularly, <i>Exod.</i> xiii.
8, 9. to wit, <i>That the </i>Jews<i> might thereby be kept in Remembrance of their
Deliverance out of </i>Egypt.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, It hath not Relation by <i>divine Precept</i>; for if it had, it
would be mentioned in that which our Adversaries account the
Institution of it, or else in the Practice of it by the Saints recorded
in Scripture; but so it is not. For as to the <i>Institution</i>, or rather
<i>Narration</i>, of Christ’s Practice in this Matter, we have it recorded
by the Evangelists <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i>, and <i>Luke</i>.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In the first two there
is only an Account of the Matter of Fact, to wit, <i>That </i>Christ<i> brake
Bread, and gave it to his Disciples to eat, saying, This is my Body; and
blessing the Cup, he gave it them to drink, saying, This is my Blood</i>; but
nothing of any Desire to them to do it. In the last, after the <i>Bread</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a>[Pg 401]</span>
(but before the <i>Blessing</i>, or giving them the <i>Wine</i>) he bids them <i>do
it in Remembrance of him</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Institution<i> of the </i>Supper<i>, or Narration of </i>Christ’s Practice<i> therein.</i></span>What we are to think of this Practice of
Christ shall be spoken of hereafter. But what necessary Relation hath
all this to the Believers partaking of the Flesh and Blood of Christ?
The End of this for which they were to do it, if at all, is to <i>remember</i>
Christ; which the Apostle yet more particularly expresses, 1 <i>Cor.</i>
xi. 26. <i>to shew forth the Lord’s Death</i>; but to <i>remember the Lord</i>, or <i>declare
his Death</i>, which are the special and particular Ends annexed to
the Use of this Ceremony, is not at all to partake of the Flesh and
Blood of Christ; neither have they any more necessary Relation to
it than any other two different spiritual Duties. For though they
that partake of the <i>Flesh and Blood of</i> Christ cannot but remember
him, yet the Lord and his Death may be remembered, as none can
deny, where his Flesh and Blood is not truly partaken of. So that
since the very particular and express End of this Ceremony may be
witnessed, to wit, the Remembrance of the Lord’s Death, and yet
the Flesh and Blood of Christ not partaken of, it cannot have had
any necessary Relation to it, else the Partaking thereof would have
been the End of it, and could not have been attained without this
Participation. But on the contrary, we may well infer hence, that
since the positive End of this Ceremony is not the Partaking of the
Flesh and Blood of Christ, and that whoever partakes of the Flesh
and Blood of Christ cannot but remember him, that therefore
such need not this Ceremony to put them in Remembrance of
him.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Well<i>, the </i>Loaves<i>, the </i>Bread<i> and </i>Wine<i>, Christ takes Occasion from, to shew the </i>inward Feeling.</span>yet it will not follow that <i>that Well</i> or <i>Water</i>
had any necessary Relation to the <i>living Water</i>, or the <i>living
Water</i> to it, <i>&amp;c.</i> So Christ takes Occasion, from the <i>Jews</i> following
him for the <i>Loaves</i>, to tell them of this <i>spiritual Bread</i> and <i>Flesh</i> of
his Body, which was more necessary for them to feed upon; it will
not therefore follow that their following him for the <i>Loaves</i> had any
necessary Relation thereunto. So also Christ here, being at Supper
with his Disciples, takes Occasion, from the <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i> which
was before them, to signify unto them, That as that <i>Bread</i> which
he brake unto them, and that <i>Wine</i> which he blessed and gave unto
them, did contribute to the Preserving and Nourishing of their
Bodies, so was he also to give his <i>Body</i> and shed his <i>Blood</i> for the
<i>Salvation</i> of their <i>Souls</i>. And therefore the very End proposed in
this Ceremony to those that observe it is, to be a <i>Memorial of his
Death</i>.</p>

<p>But if it be said, <i>That the Apostle, </i>1 Cor. x. 16.<i> calls the Bread which
he brake the Communion of the Body of Christ, and the Cup the Communion of
his Blood</i>;</p>

<p>I do most willingly subscribe unto it; but do deny that this is
understood of the outward Bread, neither can it be evinced, but
the contrary is manifest from the Context: For the Apostle in this
Chapter speaks not one Word of that Ceremony; for having in the
Beginning of it shewn them how the <i>Jews</i> of old were made Partakers
of the <i>spiritual Food</i> and <i>Water</i>, which was Christ, and how
several of them, through <i>Disobedience</i> and <i>Idolatry</i>, fell from that
good Condition, he exhorts them, by the Example of those <i>Jews</i>
whom God destroyed of old, to flee those Evils; shewing them that
they, to wit, the <i>Corinthians</i>, are likewise Partakers of the <i>Body and
Blood</i> of Christ; of which Communion they would rob themselves
if they did Evil, because <i>they could not drink of the Cup of the Lord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a>[Pg 403]</span>
the Cup of Devils, and partake of the Lord’s Table and the Table of Devils</i>,
Ver. 21. which shews that he understands not here the using of outward
Bread and Wine; because those that do drink the <i>Cup of Devils</i>,
and eat of the <i>Table of Devils</i>, yea, the wickedest of Men, may
partake of the outward Bread and outward Wine.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The wickedest may take the outward Bread and Wine.</i></span>For there the
Apostle calls the Bread <i>one</i>, Ver. 17. and he saith, <i>We being many,
are one Bread, and one Body; for we are all Partakers of that one Bread</i>.
Now if the Bread be <i>one</i>, it cannot be the <i>outward</i>, or the <i>inward</i>
would be excluded; whereas it cannot be denied but that it is the
Partaking of the <i>inward Bread</i>, and not the <i>outward</i>, that makes the
Saints truly <i>one Body</i> and <i>one Bread</i>. And whereas they say, That
the <i>one Bread</i> here comprehendeth both the <i>outward</i> and <i>inward</i>, by
Virtue of the <i>sacramental Union</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>sacramental Union<i> pretended, a </i>Figment.</span>that indeed is to affirm, but not to
prove. As for that <i>Figment</i> of a <i>sacramental Union</i>, I find not such a
Thing in all the <i>Scripture</i>, especially in the <i>New Testament</i>; nor is
there any Thing can give a Rise for such a Thing in this Chapter,
where the Apostle, as is above observed, is not at all treating of
that <i>Ceremony</i>, but only, from the Excellency of that Privilege which
the <i>Corinthians</i> had, as believing Christians, <i>to partake of the Flesh and
Blood</i> of Christ, dehorts them from <i>Idolatry</i>, and partaking of the
Sacrifices offered to <i>Idols</i>, so as thereby to offend or hurt their weak
Brethren.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But that which they most of all <i>cry out</i> for in this Matter, and
are always <i>urging</i>, is from 1 <i>Cor.</i> xi. where the Apostle is particularly
treating of this Matter, and therefore, from some Words here, they
have the greatest Appearance of Truth for their Assertion, as Ver.
27. where he calls the <i>Cup</i> the <i>Cup of the Lord</i>; and saith, <i>That they
who eat of it and drink it unworthily, are guilty of the Body and Blood of
the Lord</i>; and Ver. 29. <i>Eat and drink their own Damnation</i>; intimating
hence, that this hath an immediate or necessary Relation to the
Body, Flesh, and Blood of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>Though this at first View may catch the Unwary Reader, yet being
well considered, it doth no Ways evince the Matter in Contro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span>versy.
As for the <i>Corinthians</i> being in the Use of this Ceremony,
why they were so, and how that obliges not Christians now to the
same, shall be spoken of hereafter: It suffices at this Time to consider
that they were in the Use of it. <i>Secondly</i>, That in the Use of
it they were guilty of and committed divers Abuses. <i>Thirdly</i>, That
the Apostle here is giving them Directions how they may do it aright,
in shewing them the right and proper Use and End of it.</p>

<p>These Things being premised, let it be observed, That the very
express and particular Use of it, according to the Apostle, is <i>to shew
forth the Lord’s Death</i>, &amp;c. But <i>to shew forth the Lord’s Death, and partake
of the Flesh and Blood of</i> Christ, are different Things. He saith
not, <i>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye partake of the
Body and Blood of </i>Christ; but, <i>ye shew forth the Lord’s Death</i>. So I
acknowledge, <i>That this Ceremony</i>, by those that practise it, hath an
<i>immediate Relation</i> to the <i>outward Body</i> and <i>Death of</i> Christ upon the
<i>Cross</i>, as being properly a Memorial of it; but it doth not thence
follow that it hath any <i>inward</i> or <i>immediate Relation to Believers communicating
or partaking of the spiritual Body and Blood of </i>Christ<i>, or that
spiritual Supper</i> spoken of <i>Rev.</i> iii. 20. For though, in a general Way,
as every religious Action in some Respect hath a common Relation
to the spiritual Communion of the Saints with God, so we shall
not deny but this hath a Relation as others. Now for his calling
<i>the Cup the Cup of the Lord</i>, and saying, <i>They are guilty of the Body and
Blood of </i>Christ<i>, and eat their own <a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>Damnation in not discerning the Lord’s
Body</i>, &amp;c. I <i>answer</i>, That this infers no more necessary Relation
than any other religious Act, and amounts to no more than this,
That since the <i>Corinthians</i> were in the Use of this Ceremony, and so
performed it as a religious Act, they ought to do it worthily, or
else they should bring Condemnation upon themselves. Now this
will not more infer the Thing so practised by them to be a necessary-religious
Act obligatory upon others, than when the Apostle
saith, <i>Rom.</i> xiv. 6. <i>He that regardeth the Day, regardeth it unto the Lord</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
it can be thence inferred that the Days that some esteemed and observed
did lay an Obligation upon others to do the same. But yet,
as he that esteemed a Day, and placed Conscience in keeping it,
was to <i>regard it to the Lord</i>, and so it was to him, in so far as he dedicated
it unto the Lord, the <i>Lord’s Day</i>, he was to do it worthily;
and if he did it unworthily, he would be guilty of the <i>Lord’s Day</i>,
and so keep it to his own Damnation; so also such as observe this
<i>Ceremony of Bread and Wine</i>, it is to them the <i>Bread of the Lord</i>, and
<i>the Cup of the Lord</i>, because they use it as a religious Act; and forasmuch
as their End therein is to <i>shew forth the Lord’s Death</i>, and <i>remember
his Body</i> that was crucified for them, and his <i>Blood</i> that was
shed for them, if, notwithstanding, they believe it is their Duty to
do it, and make it a Matter of Conscience to forbear, if they do it
without that due Preparation and Examination which every religious
Act ought to be performed in, then, instead of truly remembering
the Lord’s Death, and his Body and his Blood, they render
themselves guilty of it, as being in one Spirit with those that crucified
him, and shed his Blood, though pretending with Thanksgiving
and Joy to remember it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Pharisees<i> guilty of the Blood of the </i>Prophets.</span>Thus the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i> of
old, though in Memory of the Prophets they garnished their Sepulchres,
yet are said by Christ to be <i>guilty of their Blood</i>. And that
no more can be hence inferred, appears from another Saying of the
same Apostle, <i>Rom.</i> xiv. 23. <i>He that doubteth is damned if he eat</i>, &amp;c.
where he, speaking of those that judged it unlawful to eat Flesh, <i>&amp;c.</i>
saith, <i>If they eat doubting, they eat their own Damnation</i>. Now it is manifest
from all this, that either the doing or forbearing of this was
to another, that placed no Conscience in it, of no Moment. So I
say, he that eateth that which in his Conscience he is persuaded it
is not lawful for him to eat, doth eat his own <i>Damnation</i>; so he also
that placeth Conscience in eating Bread and Wine <i>as a religious Act</i>,
if he do it unprepared, and without that due respect wherein such
Acts should be gone about, he <i>eateth and drinketh his own Damnation,
not discerning the Lord’s Body</i>, i. e. not minding what he doth, to wit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span>
<i>with a special Respect to the Lord, and by Way of special Commemoration of
the Death of Christ.</i></p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3> Having now sufficiently shewn what the true Communion
of the Body and Blood of Christ is, how it is partaken of, and how
it has no necessary Relation to that Ceremony of Bread and Wine
used by Christ with his Disciples;
<span class="sidenote">II. <i>Whether this Ceremony be a necessary Part of the New Covenant, and Obligatory.</i></span>it is fit now to consider the <i>Nature</i>
and <i>Constitution</i> of that <i>Ceremony</i> (for as to the <i>proper Use</i> of it,
we have had Occasion to speak before) whether it be a <i>standing Ordinance</i>
in the Church of Christ obligatory upon all, or indeed whether
it be any necessary Part of the Worship of the <i>New Covenant
Dispensation</i>, or hath any better or more binding Foundation than
several other Ceremonies appointed and practised about the same
Time, which the most of our Opposers acknowledge to be ceased,
and now no Ways binding upon Christians. We find this Ceremony
only mentioned in Scripture in four Places, to wit, <i>Matthew</i>,
<i>Mark</i>, and <i>Luke</i>, and by <i>Paul</i> to the <i>Corinthians</i>. If any would infer
any Thing from the Frequency of the mentioning of it, that will
add nothing; for it being a Matter of Fact, is therefore mentioned
by the Evangelists; and there are other Things less memorable as
often, yea, oftener mentioned. <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i> give only an
Account of the Matter of Fact, without any Precept to do so afterwards;
simply declaring, <a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>That Jesus at that Time did desire them
to <i>eat of the Bread, and drink of the Cup</i>; to which <i>Luke</i> adds these
Words, <i>This do in Remembrance of me</i>. If we consider this Action of
Christ with his Apostles, there will appear nothing singular in it,
for a Foundation to such a strange <i>Superstructure</i>, as many in their
airy Imaginations have sought to build upon it; for both <i>Matthew</i>
and <i>Mark</i> express it as an Act done by him as he was eating.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The breaking of Bread was no singular Thing, but a Custom among the Jews.</i></span><i>Matthew</i> saith, <i>And as they were eating</i>; and <i>Mark</i>, <i>And as they did eat, Jesus
took Bread</i>, &amp;c. Now this Act was no singular Thing, neither
any solemn Institution of a <i>Gospel Ordinance</i>; because it was a constant Custom among the <i>Jews</i>,
<span class="sidenote">P. Riccius.</span>as <i>Paulus Riccius</i> observes at Length in his <i>Celestial Agriculture</i>, that when they did eat the Passover, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span>
Master of the Family did take Bread, and bless it, and breaking it,
gave of it to the rest; and likewise taking Wine, did the same; so
that there can nothing further appear in this, than that Jesus Christ,
<i>who fulfilled all Righteousness</i>, and also observed the <i>Jewish Feasts and
Customs</i>, used this also among his Disciples only, that as in most
other Things he laboured to draw their Minds to a further Thing,
so in the Use of this he takes Occasion to put them in Mind of his
Death and Sufferings, which were shortly to be; which he did the
oftener inculcate unto them, for that they were averse from believing it.
<span class="sidenote">What it is<i> to do this in Remembrance of Christ.</i></span>And as for that Expression of <i>Luke</i>, <i>Do this in Remembrance
of me</i>, it will amount to no more than this, that being the last Time
that Christ did eat with his Disciples, he desired them, that in their
eating and drinking they might have Regard to him, and by the Remembering
of that Opportunity, be the more stirred up to follow
him diligently through Sufferings and Death, <i>&amp;c.</i> But what Man
of Reason, laying aside the Prejudice of Education, and the Influence
of Tradition, will say, That this Account of the <i>Matter of
Fact</i> given by <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i>, or this Expression of <i>Luke</i>, to <i>Do
that in Remembrance of him</i>, will amount to these Consequences, which
the Generality of Christians have sought to draw from it; as calling
it, <i>Augustissimum Eucharistiæ Sacramentum</i>; <i>venerabile Altaris Sacramentum</i>;
<i>the principal Seal of the Covenant of Grace, by which all the Benefits of
Christ’s Death are sealed to Believers</i>; and such like Things? But to
give a further Evidence, how these Consequences have not any
Bottom from the Practice of that Ceremony, nor from the Words
following, <i>Do this</i>, &amp;c. let us consider another of the like Nature, as
it is at Length expressed by <i>John</i>, Chap. xiii. 3, 4. 8. 13, 14, 15.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s washing of Feet, and its Manner related.</i></span><i>Jesus riseth from Supper, and laid aside his Garments, and took a Towel, and
girded himself: After that, he poureth Water into a Bason, and began to
wash the Disciples’ Feet; and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was
girded: </i>Peter<i> said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my Feet; </i>Jesus<i> answered
him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no Part with me. So after he had
washed their Feet,&mdash;he said, Know ye what I have done to you? If I then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span>
your Lord and Master have washed your Feet, ye also ought to wash one
another’s Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: shall">should</span> do as I have
done to you.</i> As to which, let it be observed, that <i>John</i> relates this
Passage to have been done at the same Time with the other of <i>breaking Bread</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Compared with the </i>breaking<i> of </i>Bread.</span>both being done the Night of the <i>Passover</i>, after Supper.
If we regard the Narration of this, and the Circumstances attending
it, it was done with far more Solemnity, and prescribed far more
punctually and particularly than the former. It is said only, <i>As he
was eating, he took Bread</i>; so that this would seem to be but an <i>occasional
Business</i>: But here <i>he rose up</i>, <i>he laid by his Garments</i>, <i>he girded
himself</i>, <i>he poured out the Water</i>, <i>he washed their Feet</i>, <i>he wiped them with
a Towel</i>: He did this to all of them; which are Circumstances surely
far more observable than those noted in the other. The <i>former</i> was
a Practice common among the <i>Jews</i>, used by all Masters of Families
upon that Occasion; but <i>this</i>, as to the Manner, and Person acting
it, <i>to wit</i>, for the Master to rise up, and wash the Feet of his Servants
and Disciples, was more singular and observable. In the
breaking of <i>Bread</i>, and giving of Wine, it is not pleaded by our Adversaries,
nor yet mentioned in the Text, that he particularly put
them into the Hands of all; but breaking it, and blessing it, gave
it the nearest, and so they from Hand to Hand: But here it is
mentioned, that he washed not the Feet of one or two, but of
many. He saith not in the <i>former</i>, <i>That if they do not eat of that Bread,
and drink of that Wine, they shall be prejudiced by it</i>; but here he saith
expresly to <i>Peter</i>, That <i>if he wash him not, he hath no Part with him</i>;
which being spoken upon <i>Peter</i>’s refusing to let him wash his Feet,
would seem to import no less, than not the Continuance only, but
even the Necessity of this <i>Ceremony</i>. In the former he saith, as it
were passingly, <i>Do this in Remembrance of me</i>; but here he sitteth
down again, he desires them to consider what he hath done, tells them positively,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The washing one another’s Feet was left as an Example.</i></span><i>That as he hath done to them, so ought they to do to one
another</i>: And yet again, he redoubles that Precept, by telling them,
<i>He has given them an Example, that they should do so likewise</i>. If we re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>spect
the Nature of the Thing, it hath as much in it as either <i>Baptism</i>
or the <i>breaking of Bread</i>; seeing it is an outward Element of a
cleansing Nature, applied to the outward Man, by the Command
and the Example of Christ, to signify an inward Purifying. I would
willingly propose this seriously to Men, who will be pleased to
make use of that Reason and Understanding that God hath given
them, and not be imposed upon, nor abused by the Custom or Tradition
of others; <i>Whether this Ceremony, if we respect either the Time
that it was appointed in, or the Circumstances wherewith it was performed,
or the Command enjoining the Use of it, hath not as much to recommend it
for a standing Ordinance of the Gospel, as either </i>Water-baptism<i>, or </i>Bread<i>
and </i>Wine<i>, or any other of that Kind?</i> I wonder then what Reason
the <i>Papists</i> can give, Why they have not numbered it among their
<i>Sacraments</i>, except merely <i>Voluntas Ecclesiæ &amp; Traditio Patrum</i>.</div>

not be extended to all, as well as that of the <i>Eucharist</i> (as they
term it) or whence it appears from the Text, that [<i>Do this in Remembrance
of me</i>] should be interpreted that the <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i> were
every Day to be taken by all <i>Priests</i>, or the <i>Bread</i> every Day, or every
Week, by the <i>People</i>; and that that other Command of Christ, <i>Ye

<i>Pope</i>, or some other Persons, to be done only to a few, and that
once a Year? Surely there can be no other Reason for this Difference
assigned from the Text.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Protestants<i> use not the </i>washing of Feet.</span>And as to <i>Protestants</i>, who use not
this Ceremony at all, if they will but open their Eyes, they may
see how that by Custom and Tradition they are abused in this Matter,
as were their Fathers in divers <i>Popish</i> Traditions. For if we
look into the plain Scripture, what can be thence inferred to urge
the one, which may not be likewise pleaded for the other; or for
laying aside the one, which may not be likewise said against the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>[Pg 410]</span>tinuance
of the other? If they say, <i>That the former, of washing the
Feet, was only a Ceremony</i>; what have they, whence they can shew,
that this <i>breaking of Bread</i> is more? If they say, <i>That the former was
only a Sign of Humility and Purifying</i>; what have they to prove that
this was more? If they say, <i>That one was only for a Time, and was no
Evangelical Ordinance</i>; what hath this to make it such, that the other
wanted? Surely there is no Way of Reason to evade this; neither
can any Thing be alleged, that the one should cease, and not the
other; or the one continue, and not the other; but the mere Opinion
of the Affirmers, which by Custom, Education and Tradition,
hath begotten in the Hearts of People a greater Reverence for, and
Esteem of the one than the other; which if it had fallen out to be
as much recommended to us by Tradition, would no Doubt have
been as tenaciously pleaded for, as having no less Foundation in
Scripture. But since the former, to wit, <i>The washing of one another’s
Feet</i>, is justly laid aside, as not binding upon <i>Christians</i>; so ought also
the other for the same Reason.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>breaking<i> of </i>Bread<i> not used now in the same Manner as Christ did.</i></span>But it is strange that those who are so clamorous for this

could hear of, except some <i>Baptists</i> who now do it, use it in the same
Way that he did: Christ did it at <i>Supper</i>, while they were eating;
but the Generality of <i>Protestants</i> do it in the <i>Morning</i> only by itself.

Regard to that which alone can be pleaded for an Institution, <i>viz.</i>
these Words, <i>Do this in Remembrance of me</i>; it doth as properly relate
to the Manner as Matter. For what may or can they evince in Reason,

have seen me eat it at Supper with you, who take Bread, and break it, and
give it you; and take the Cup, and bless it, and give it you; so do ye likewise</i>?
And seeing Christ makes no Distinction in those Words, <i>Do
this</i>, it cannot be judged in Reason but to relate to the Whole;

than that which Christ used? And yet would not our Adversaries

the <i>Jews</i> made use of <i>unleavened Bread</i> in the <i>Passover</i>, that it was
such Kind of <i>Bread</i> that Christ did break to his Disciples; the

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>That the Clergy only were present</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>Then will not that open a Door for the <i>Popish Argument</i> against
the <i>Administration of the Cup to the People</i>? Or may not another from
thence as easily infer, <i>That the Clergy only ought to partake of this Ceremony</i>;
because they were the Apostles only then present, to whom it
was said, <i>Do this</i>? But if this [<i>Do this</i>] be extended to all, how
comes it all have not Liberty to obey it, in both <i>blessing</i>, <i>breaking</i>,
and <i>distributing</i>, as well as <i>taking</i> and <i>eating</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Hot Contests about the Manner of taking it, and to whom to give it</i>.</span>Besides all these, even
the <i>Calvinist Protestants</i> of <i>Great Britain</i> could never yet accord among
themselves about the <i>Manner of taking it</i>, whether <i>sitting</i>, <i>standing</i>, or
<i>kneeling</i>; whether it should be given to the <i>Sick</i>, and those that are
<i>ready to die</i>, or not? Which Controversies, though they may be
esteemed of small Moment, yet have greatly contributed, with
other Things, to be the Occasion, not only of <i>much Contention</i>, but
also of <i>Bloodshed</i> and <i>Devastation</i>; so that in this last Respect the <i>Prelatick
Calvinists</i> have termed the <i>Presbyterians</i> schismatical and pertinacious;
and they them again superstitious, idolatrous, and papistical.
Who then, that will open their Eyes, but may see that the
Devil hath flirted up this Contention and Zeal, to busy Men about
Things of <i>small Moment</i>, that <i>greater Matters</i> may be neglected, while
he keeps them in such ado about this Ceremony; though they lay
aside others of the like Nature, as <i>positively commanded</i>, and as <i>punc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>[Pg 413]</span>tually
practised</i>; and from the Observation of which half so many
Difficulties will not follow?</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3> How then? Have we not Reason, not finding the Nature
of this Practice, to be obligatory upon us, more than those
others which our Adversaries have laid aside, to avoid this Confusion;
since those that use it can never agree, neither concerning the
<i>Nature</i>, <i>Efficacy</i>, nor <i>Manner of doing it</i>? And this proceeds, because
they take it not plainly, as it lies in the Scripture; but have so
much intermixed their own Inventions. For would they take it as
it lies, it would import no more, than that <i>Jesus Christ at that Time
did thereby signify unto them, that his Body and Blood was to be offered for
them</i>; and desired them, That <i>whensoever they did eat or drink, they
might do it in Remembrance of him, or with a Regard to him, whose Blood was
shed for them</i>. Now that the <i>Primitive Church</i>, gathered immediately after
his Ascension, did so understand it, doth appear from their Use and
Practice, if we admit those Places of the <i>Acts</i>, where <i>breaking of Bread</i>
is spoken of, to have Relation hereto;
<span class="sidenote"><i>By </i>breaking of Bread<i> they had all Things in <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: common in remembering">common, remembering</span> the Lord.</i></span>which as our Adversaries do, so
we shall willingly agree to: As <i>First</i>, <i>Acts</i> ii. 42. <i>And they continued stedfastly
in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread</i>, &amp;c. This
cannot be understood of any other than of their ordinary eating;
for as nothing else appears from the Text, so the Context makes it
plain; for they had all Things in common: And therefore it is
said, Ver. 46. <i>And they continuing daily with one Accord in the Temple, and
breaking Bread from House to House, did eat their Meat with Gladness and
Singleness of Heart.</i> Those who will not wilfully close their Eyes,
may see here, that the <i>breaking</i> being joined with their <i>eating</i>, shews,
that nothing else is here expressed, but that having all Things in
common, and so continuing together, they also did break their Bread,
and eat their Meat together: In doing whereof, I cannot doubt but
they remembered the Lord; to follow whom they had, with so
much Zeal and Resignation, betaken themselves. This is further
manifest from <i>Acts</i> vi. 2. for the <i>Apostles</i>, having the Care and Distribution
of that Money, which the Believers, having sold their Pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a>[Pg 414]</span>sessions,
gave unto them, and finding themselves overcharged with
that Burthen, appointed <i>Deacons</i> for that Business, that they might
give themselves continually to <i>Prayer</i>, and to the <i>Ministry of the Word</i>;
not leaving that, to serve Tables.
<span class="sidenote">Deacons<i> appointed for serving Tables.</i></span>This cannot be meant of any
<i>sacramental Eating</i>, or <i>religious Acts of Worship</i>; seeing our Adversaries
make the Distributing of that the proper Act of <i>Ministers</i>, not of <i>Deacons</i>:
And yet there can be no Reason alleged, That that <i>breaking of
Bread</i>, which they are said to have <i>continued in</i>, and to have done
from <i>House to House</i>, was other than those <i>Tables</i> which the Apostles
served; but here gave over, as finding themselves overcharged with
it. Now as the Increase of the Disciples did incapacitate the Apostles
any more to manage this; so it would seem their further Increase,
and dispersing in divers Places, hindered the Continuance
of that Practice of <i>having Things in common</i>: But notwithstanding,
so far at least to remember or continue that <i>ancient Community</i>, they
did at certain Times come together, and break Bread together.
<span class="sidenote"><i>At</i> Troas <i>the Supper deferred till Midnight</i>.</span>Hence it is said, <i>Acts</i> xx. 7. on <i>Paul</i>’s coming to <i>Troas</i>, That <i>upon
the fist Day of the Week, when the Disciples came together to break Bread,
</i>Paul<i> preached unto them, ready to depart on the Morrow, and continued his
Speech until Midnight</i>. Here is no Mention made of any <i>sacramental
Eating</i>; but only that <i>Paul</i> took Occasion from their being together
to preach unto them. And it seems it was a <i>Supper</i> they intended
(not a <i>Morning-bit</i> of <i>Bread</i>, and <i>Sup</i> of <i>Wine</i>) else it is not very probable
that <i>Paul</i> would from the <i>Morning</i> have preached until <i>Midnight</i>.
But the 11th Verse puts the Matter out of Dispute, which
is thus: <i>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken Bread,
and eaten, and talked a long While, even till Break of Day, so he departed</i>.
This shews, That the <i>breaking of Bread</i> was deferred till that Time;
for these Words [<i>and when he had broken Bread, and eaten</i>] do shew,
That it had a Relation to the <i>breaking of Bread</i> before-mentioned,
and that that was the Time he did it. <i>Secondly</i>, These Words joined
together [<i>and when he had broken Bread, and eaten, and talked</i>] shew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>[Pg 415]</span>
it was no religious Act of Worship, but only an Eating for bodily
Refreshment,
<span class="sidenote"><i>They only did eat for refreshing the Body.</i></span>for which the <i>Christians</i> used to meet together some
Time; and doing it in <i>God’s Fear</i>, and <i>Singleness of Heart</i>, doth
notwithstanding difference it from the Eating or Feasting of <i>profane
Persons</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>By some called a </i>Love-feast.</span>And this by some is called a <i>Love-feast</i>, or a being together,
not merely to feed their Bellies, or for outward Ends; but
to take thence Occasion to eat and drink together, in the Dread and
Presence of the Lord, as his People; which <i>Custom</i> we shall not condemn.
But let it be observed, That in all the <i>Acts</i> there is no other
nor further Mention of this Matter. But if that <i>Ceremony</i> had been
some <i>solemn Sacrifice</i>, as some will have it, or such a <i>special Sacrament</i>
as others plead it to be; it is strange that that <i>History</i>, which in
many less Things gives a particular Account of the <i>Christians</i> Behaviour,
should have been so silent in the Matter: Only we find,
That they used sometimes to meet together to break Bread, and eat.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Christians<i> began by Degrees to depart from the Primitive Purity.</i></span>Now as the <i>early Christians</i> began by Degrees to depart from that primitive
Purity and Simplicity, so did they also to accumulate superstitious
Traditions, and vitiate the innocent Practices of their Predecessors,
by the Intermixing either of <i>Jewish</i> or <i>Heathenish Rites</i>;
and likewise in the Use of this, Abuses began very early to creep in
among Christians, so that it was needful for the Apostle <i>Paul</i> to reform
them, and reprove them for it, as he doth at large, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xi.
from Ver. 17. to the End:
<span class="sidenote">1 Cor. 11. 17.</span>Which Place we shall particularly examine,
because our Adversaries lay the chief Stress of their Matter
upon it;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Concerning the </i>Supper<i> of the </i>Lord<i> (so called) explained</i>.</span>and we shall see whether it will infer any more than we
have above granted. <i>First</i>, Because they were apt to use that Practice
in a superstitious Mind beyond the true Use of it, so as to make
of it some <i>mystical Supper of the Lord</i>, he tells them, Ver. 20. That
their <i>coming together into one Place, is not to eat the Lord’s Supper</i>; he
saith not, <i>This is not the </i>right Manner<i> to eat</i>; but, <i>This is</i> <span class="smcap">NOT</span> <i>to eat
the Lord’s Supper</i>; because the <i>Supper of the Lord is spiritual</i>, and a <i>Mystery</i>.
<i>Secondly</i>, He blames them, in that they came together for the
<i>Worse</i>, and not for the <i>Better</i>; the Reason he gives of this is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>[Pg 416]</span>
Ver. 21. <i>For in Eating every one hath taken before his own Supper; and
one is hungry, and another is drunken.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Why the Custom of </i>Supping in common<i> was used among Christians.</i></span>Here it is plain that the
Apostle condemns them in that (because this Custom of <i>Supping</i> in
General was used among Christians to increase their Love, and as a
Memorial of Christ’s Supping with the Disciples) they had so vitiated
it, as to eat it apart, and to come full, who had Abundance;
and hungry, who had little at Home; whereby the very Use and
End of this <i>Practice</i> was lost and perverted: And therefore he blames
them, that they did not either eat this in Common at Home, or reserve
their Eating till they came all together to the publick Assembly.
This appears plainly by the following Ver. 22. <i>Have ye not
Houses to eat and drink in? Or despise ye the Church of God, and shame
them that have not?</i> Where he blames them for their irregular Practice
herein, in that they despised to eat orderly, or reserve their Eating
to the publick Assembly; and so shaming such, as not having
Houses, nor Fulness at Home, came to partake of the common
Table; who, being hungry, thereby were shamed, when they observed
others come thither full and drunken. Those that without
Prejudice will look to the Place, will see this must have been the
Case among the <i>Corinthians</i>: For supposing the Use of this to have
been then, as now used either by <i>Papists</i>, <i>Lutherans</i>, or <i>Calvinists</i>, it
is hard making Sense of the Apostle’s Words, or indeed to conceive
what was the Abuse the <i>Corinthians</i> committed in this Thing. Having
thus observed what the Apostle said above,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Rise of that Custom.</i></span>because this Custom
of <i>Eating and Drinking together some Time</i> had its Rise from Christ’s
Act with the Apostles the Night he was betrayed; therefore the
Apostle proceeds, Ver. 23. to give them an Account of that: <i>For I
have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord
Jesus, the same Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread</i>, &amp;c. Those
that understand the Difference betwixt a <i>Narration</i> of a Thing, and
a <i>Command</i>, cannot but see, if they will, That there is no Command
in this Place, but only an Account of <i>Matter of Fact</i>; he saith not,
<i>I received of the Lord, that as he took Bread, so I should command it to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a>[Pg 417]</span>
to do so likewise</i>; there is nothing like this in the Place: Yea, on the
contrary, Ver. 25. where he repeats Christ’s imperative Words to
his Apostles, he placeth them so as they import no Command; <i>This
do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in Remembrance of me</i>: And then he adds,
<i>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord’s
Death till he come</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>That </i>[As often]<i> imports no Command of this Supper.</i></span>But these Words [<i>As often</i>] import no more a <i>Command</i>,
than to say, <i>As often as thou goest to </i>Rome<i>, see the Capitol</i>, will
infer a <i>Command</i> to me to go thither.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But whereas they urge the last Words, <i>Ye shew forth the Lord’s
Death till he come</i>; insinuating, That <i>this imports a necessary Continuance
of that </i>Ceremony<i>, until Christ come at the End of the World to Judgment</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, They take two of the chief Parts of the Controversy
here for granted, without Proof. <i>First</i>, That [<i>as often</i>] imports a
<i>Command</i>; the contrary whereof is shewn; neither will they ever be
able to prove it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christ’s outward and inward Coming.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, That this <i>Coming</i> is to be understood of
<i>Christ’s last outward Coming</i>, and not of his <i>inward</i> and <i>spiritual</i>, that remains
to be proved: Whereas the Apostle might well understand it
of his <i>inward Coming</i> and <i>Appearance</i>, which perhaps some of those
carnal <i>Corinthians</i>, that used to come drunken together, had not
yet known; and others, being weak among them, and inclinable
to dote upon <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Outwards">Externals</span>, this might have been indulged to them
for a Season, and even used by them who knew Christ’s Appearance
in Spirit (as other Things were, of which we shall speak
hereafter) especially by the Apostle, who became <i>weak</i> to the <i>Weak</i>,
and <i>all</i> to <i>All</i>, that he might <i>save some</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>To remember Christ’s Death till he come to arise in the Heart</i>.</span>Now those weak and carnal
<i>Corinthians</i> might be permitted the Use of this, to shew forth,
or remember Christ’s Death, till he came to arise in them; for
though such need those outward Things to put them in Mind of
<i>Christ’s Death</i>, yet those who are <i>dead with Christ</i>, and not only <i>dead
with Christ</i>, but <i>buried</i>, and also <i>arisen</i> with him, need not such <i>Signs</i>
to remember him: And to such therefore the Apostle saith, <i>Col.</i> iii. 1.
<i>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those Things which are above, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>[Pg 418]</span>
Christ sitteth on the right Hand of God</i>: But <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i> are not those
Things that are above, but are Things of the Earth. But that this
whole Matter was a mere Act of Indulgence and Condescension of
the Apostle <i>Paul</i> to the weak and carnal <i>Corinthians</i>, appears yet more
by the <i>Syriack</i><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Copy, which Ver. 17. in his entering upon this
Matter, hath it thus; <i>In that concerning which I am about to command
you (</i>or<i> instruct you) I commend you not, because ye have not gone forward,
but are descended unto that which is less, </i>or<i> of less Consequence</i>: Clearly importing,
That the Apostle was grieved that such was their Condition,
that he was forced to give them Instructions concerning those outward
Things; and doting upon which, they shewed they were not gone
forward in the <i>Life of Christianity</i>, but rather sticking in <i>beggarly Elements</i>.
And therefore Ver. 20. the same <i>Version</i> hath it thus, <i>When
then ye meet together, ye do not do it, as it is just ye should do in the Day of
the Lord, ye eat and drink it</i>: Therefore shewing to them, That to meet
together to eat and drink <i>outward Bread and Wine</i>, was not the Labour
and Work of that <i>Day of the Lord</i>. But since our Adversaries are so
zealous for this <i>Ceremony</i>, because used by the Church of <i>Corinth</i>
(though with how little Ground is already shewn) how come they
to pass over far more positive Commands of the Apostles, as Matters
of no Moment? As <i>First</i>, <i>Acts</i> xv. 29. where the Apostles peremptorily
command the <i>Gentiles</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>To abstain from Things strangled.</i></span>as that which was the Mind of the
Holy Ghost, <i>To abstain from Things strangled, and from Blood</i>: And
<i>James</i> v. 14.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Anointing with Oil.</i></span>where it is expresly commanded, <i>That the Sick be anointed
with Oil in the Name of the Lord</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_133_133" id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> And likewise the other <i>Oriental Versions</i>, as the <i>Arabick</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i>, have it the same
Way.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If they say, <i>Those were only temporary Things, but not to continue</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>What have they more to shew for this; there being no express
Repeal of them?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If they say, <i>The Repeal is implied, because the Apostle saith, We ought
not to be judged in Meats and Drinks</i>;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>[Pg 419]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I admit the <i>Answer</i>: But how can it be prevented from militating
the same Way against the other Practice? Surely not at all: Nor
can there be any Thing urged for the one more than for the other,
but Custom and Tradition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>As for that of <i>James</i>, they say, <i>There followed a Miracle upon it</i>,
to wit, <i>The Recovery of the Sick</i>; <i>but this being ceased, so should the
Ceremony</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>Though this might many Ways be answered, to wit, That <i>Prayer</i>
then might as well be <i>forborn</i>, to which also the <i>Saving of the Sick</i> is
there ascribed; yet I shall accept of it, because I judge indeed that
<i>Ceremony</i> is ceased;
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Ceremony ought to cease, its Virtue failing</i>.</span>only methinks, since our Adversaries, and that
rightly, think a <i>Ceremony</i> ought to cease where the Virtue fails, they
ought by the same Rule to forbear the <i>laying on of Hands</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Thus laying on of Hands.</i></span>in Imitation
of the Apostles, since the Gift of the <i>Holy Ghost</i> doth not follow
upon it.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IX.</h3> But since we find that several Testimonies of Scripture do
sufficiently shew, That such <i>external Rites are no necessary Part of the
New Covenant Dispensation, therefore not needful now to continue</i>, however
they were for a Season practised of old, I shall instance some few of
them, whereby from the Nature of the Thing, as well as those Testimonies,
it may appear, That the Ceremony of <i>Bread and Wine</i> is
ceased, as well as those other Things confessed by our Adversaries
to be so.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ceremony of </i>Bread<i> and </i>Wine<i> is ceased.</i></span>The first is <i>Rom.</i> xiv. 17. <i>For the Kingdom of God is not
Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost</i>:
Here the Apostle evidently shews, That the <i>Kingdom of God</i>, or <i>Gospel
of Christ</i>, stands not in <i>Meats and Drinks</i>, and such like Things, but
in <i>Righteousness</i>, &amp;c. as by the Context doth appear, where he is
speaking of the <i>Guilt</i> and <i>Hazard</i> of judging one another about <i>Meats
and Drinks</i>. So then, if the <i>Kingdom of God</i> stand not in them, nor
the <i>Gospel</i>, nor <i>Work of Christ</i>, then the eating of outward <i>Bread and
Wine</i> can be no necessary Part of the <i>Gospel-worship</i>, nor any <i>perpetual
Ordinance</i> of it. Another of the same Apostle is yet more plain,
<i>Col.</i> ii. 16. the Apostle throughout this whole <i>second Chapter</i> doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a>[Pg 420]</span>
clearly plead for us, and against the <i>Formality</i> and <i>Superstition</i> of our
Opposers: For in the Beginning he holds forth the great <i>Privileges</i>
which Christians have by Christ, who are indeed come to the <i>Life
of Christianity</i>; and therefore he desires them, Ver. 6. <i>As they have received
Christ, so to walk in him; and to beware, lest they be spoiled through
Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Rudiments or Elements of the World;
because that in Christ, whom they have received, is all Fulness: And that
they are circumcised with the Circumcision made without Hands (</i>which he
calls the<i> Circumcision of Christ) and being buried with him by Baptism,
are also arisen with him through the Faith of the Operation of God.</i> Here
also they did partake of the <i>true Baptism of Christ</i>; and being such
as are <i>arisen</i> with him, let us see whether he thinks it needful they
should make use of such <i>Meat and Drink</i> as <i>Bread and Wine</i>, <i>to put
them in Remembrance of Christ’s Death</i>; or whether they ought to be
judged, that they did it not; Ver. 16. <i>Let no Man therefore judge
you in Meat and Drink</i>: Is not <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i> <i>Meat</i> and <i>Drink</i>? But
why? <i>Which are a Shadow of Things to come: But the Body is of Christ.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>’Tis but a </i>Sign<i> and </i>Shadow<i> they confess.</i></span>Then since our Adversaries confess, That their <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i> is
a <i>Sign</i> or <i>Shadow</i>; therefore, according to the Apostle’s Doctrine,
we ought not to be <i>judged</i> in the Non-observation of it. But is it
not fit for those that are <i>dead with Christ</i> to be subject to such Ordinances?
<span class="sidenote"><i>And which do perish with the Using.</i></span>See what he saith, Ver. 20. <i>Wherefore if ye be dead with
</i>Christ<i> from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the
World, are ye subject to Ordinances? (Touch not, taste not, handle not:
Which all are to perish with the Using) after the Commandments and Doctrines
of Men.</i> What can be more plain? If this serve not to take
away the absolute Necessity of the Use of <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>, what can
it serve to take away? Sure I am, the Reason here given is applicable
to them, <i>which all do perish with the Using</i>; since <i>Bread</i> and
<i>Wine</i> perish with the Using, as much as other Things. But further,
If the Use of <i>Water</i>, and <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>, were that wherein the very
<i>Seals</i> of the <i>New Covenant</i> stood, and did pertain to the chief <i>Sacraments</i>
of the <i>Gospel</i> and <i>Evangelical Ordinances</i> (so called) then would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a>[Pg 421]</span>
not the <i>Gospel</i> differ from the <i>Law</i>, or be preferable to it.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Law was Meats and Drinks; not so the Gospel.</i></span>Whereas
the Apostle shews the Difference, <i>Heb.</i> ix. 10. in that such Kind of
Observations of the <i>Jews</i> were as a Sign of the <i>Gospel</i>, for that they
<i>stood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Washings</i>. But if the <i>Gospel-worship</i>
and <i>Service</i> stand in the same, where is the Difference?</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>These under the </i>Gospel<i> have a spiritual Signification</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>So had those under the <i>Law</i>; God was the Author of those, as
well as Christ is pretended to be the Author of these. But doth
not this contending for the Use of <i>Water</i>, <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>, as necessary
Parts of the <i>Gospel-worship</i>, destroy the Nature of it, as if the
<i>Gospel</i> were a Dispensation of <i>Shadows</i>, and not of the <i>Substance</i>?
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Law has</i> Shadows, <i>the Gospel brings the Substance</i>.</span>Whereas the Apostle, in that of the <i>Colossians</i> above-mentioned, argues
against the Use of these Things, as needful to those that are <i>dead</i>
and <i>arisen</i> with Christ, because they are but <i>Shadows</i>. And since,
through the whole <i>Epistle</i> to the <i>Hebrews</i>, he argues with the <i>Jews</i>, to
<i>wean</i> them from their <i>old Worship</i>, for this Reason, because it was
<i>typical</i> and <i>figurative</i>; is it agreeable to right Reason to bring them
to another of the same Nature? What Ground from <i>Scripture</i> or
<i>Reason</i> can our Adversaries bring us, to evince that one <i>Shadow</i> or
<i>Figure</i> should point to another <i>Shadow</i> or <i>Figure</i>, and not to the
<i>Substance</i>? And yet they make the Figure of <i>Circumcision</i> to point to
<i>Water-baptism</i>, and the <i>Paschal Lamb</i> to <i>Bread and Wine</i>. But was it
ever known that one Figure was the <i>Anti-type</i> of the other, especially
seeing <i>Protestants</i> make not these their <i>Anti-types</i> to have any
more Virtue and Efficacy than the <i>Type</i> had?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Their </i>Sacraments<i> confer not Grace.</i></span>For since, as they say,
and that truly, <i>That their Sacraments confer not Grace, but that it is conferred
according to the Faith of the Receiver</i>, it will not be denied
but the Faithful among the <i>Jews</i> received also Grace in the Use of
their <i>Figurative Worship</i>. And though <i>Papists</i> boast that their Sacraments
confer Grace <i>ex opere operato</i>, yet Experience abundantly
proveth the contrary.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Opposers claim a Power to give their Sacraments; from whence do they derive it?</i></span>But supposing the Use of <i>Water-baptism</i> and <i>Bread and Wine</i>
to have been in the Primitive Church, as was also that of <i>abstaining
from Things strangled</i>, <i>and from Blood</i>, <i>the Use of Legal Purification</i>, Acts
xxi. 23, 24, 25. and <i>anointing of the Sick with Oil</i>, for the Reasons
and Grounds before mentioned; yet it remains for our Adversaries
to shew us how they come by Power or Authority to administer
them. It cannot be from the Letter of the Scripture, else they
ought also to do those other Things, which the Letter declares also
they did, and which in the Letter have as much Foundation. Then
their Power must be <i>derived from the Apostles</i>, either <i>mediately</i> or <i>immediately</i>;
but we have shewn before, in the <i>tenth Proposition</i>, that they
have no <i>mediate Power</i>, because of the Interruption made by the
<i>Apostasy</i>; and for an <i>immediate Power</i> or <i>Command</i> by the Spirit of God
to administer these Things, none of our Adversaries pretend to it.
We know that in this, as in other Things, they make a Noise of
the <i>constant Consent of the Church, and of Christians in all Ages</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Tradition no sufficient Ground for </i>Faith.</span>but as
<i>Tradition</i> is not a sufficient Ground for <i>Faith</i>, so in this Matter especially
it ought to have but small Weight; for that in this Point of
<i>Ceremonies</i> and <i>superstitious Observations</i> the Apostasy began very early,
as may appear in the <i>Epistle</i> of <i>Paul</i> to the <i>Galatians</i> and <i>Colossians</i>; and
we have no Ground to imitate them in those Things, whose Entrance
the Apostle so much <i>withstood</i>, so heavily <i>regretted</i>, and so
sharply <i>reproved</i>. But if we look to <i>Antiquity</i>, we find that in such
Kind of Observances and Traditions they were very uncertain and
changeable; so that neither <i>Protestants</i> nor <i>Papists</i> do observe this
Ceremony as they did, both in that they gave it to <i>young Boys</i>,
and to <i>little Children</i>:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Supper<i> they gave to young Boys and Children.</i></span>And for aught can be learned, the Use of this
and <i>Infant-baptism</i> are of a like Age, though the one be laid aside
both by <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, and the other, to wit, <i>Baptism of Infants</i>,
be stuck to. And we have so much the less Reason to lay
Weight upon <i>Antiquity</i>, for that if we consider their Profession of
Religion, especially as to Worship, and the ceremonial Part of it,
we shall not find any Church now, whether <i>Popish</i> or <i>Protestant</i>, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a>[Pg 423]</span>
differ not widely from them in many Things,
<span class="sidenote">Dallæus.</span>as <i>Dallæus</i>, in his
Treatise concerning the <i>Use of the Fathers</i>, well observeth and demonstrateth.
And why they should obtrude this upon us because of the
<i>Ancients Practice</i>, which they themselves follow not, or why we may
not reject this, as well as they do other Things no less zealously
practised by the <i>Ancients</i>, no sufficient Reason can be assigned.</div>

<p>Nevertheless I doubt not but many, whose Understandings have
been clouded with these <i>Ceremonies</i>, have notwithstanding, by the
Mercy of God, had some secret Sense of the <i>Mystery</i>, which they
could not clearly understand, because it was sealed from them by
their sticking to such outward Things; and that through that secret
Sense diving in their Comprehensions they ran themselves into
these carnal Apprehensions, as imagining the <i>Substance</i> of the <i>Bread</i>
was changed, or that if the <i>Substance</i> was not changed, yet the <i>Body</i>
was there, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>Calvin’s ingenuous Confession commended.</i></span>And indeed I am inclinable very favourably to
judge of <i>Calvin</i> in this Particular, in that he deals so ingenuously to
confess he <i>neither comprehends it, nor can express it in Words</i>; <i>but yet by
a feeling Experience can say, The Lord is spiritually present</i>. Now as I
doubt not but <i>Calvin</i> sometimes had a Sense of his <i>Presence</i> without
the Use of this Ceremony, so as the Understanding given him of
God made him justly reject the false Notions of <i>Transubstantiation</i> and
<i>Consubstantiation</i>, though he knew not what to establish instead of them,
if he had fully waited in the <a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a><i>Light that makes all Things manifest</i>, and
had not laboured in his own Comprehension to settle upon that external
Ceremony, by affixing the <i>spiritual Presence</i> as chiefly or principally,
though not only, as he well knew by Experience, there, or
especially to relate to it, he might have further reached unto the
Knowledge of this <i>Mystery</i> than many that went before him.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> Liberty of <i>Conscience</i> from the Power of the Civil Magistrate
hath been of late Years so largely and learnedly
handled, that I shall need to be but brief in it; yet it is to be lamented
that few have walked answerably to this Principle, each
pleading it for themselves, but scarce allowing it to others, as hereafter
I shall have Occasion more at length to observe.</div>

<p>It will be fit in the first Place, for clearing of Mistakes, to say
something of the <i>State</i> of the <i>Controversy</i>, that what follows may be the
more clearly understood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>What Conscience is.</i></span>By <i>Conscience</i> then, as in the Explanation of the <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth Propositions</i>
I have observed, is to be understood, <i>That Persuasion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a>[Pg 426]</span>
Mind which arises from the Understanding’s being possessed with the Belief of
the Truth or Falsity of any Thing</i>; which though it may be false or evil
upon the Matter, yet if a Man should go against his Persuasion or
Conscience, he would commit a Sin; because what a Man doth contrary
to his Faith, though his Faith be wrong, is no Ways acceptable
to God. Hence the Apostle saith, <a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a><i>Whatsoever is not of Faith, is Sin</i>;
<i>and he that doubteth is damned if he eat</i>; though the Thing might have
been lawful to another; and that this Doubting to eat some Kind of
<i>Meats</i> (since all the Creatures of God are good, and for the Use of
Man, <i>if received with Thanksgiving</i>) might be a Superstition, or at least
a Weakness, which were better removed. Hence <i>Ames. de Cas.
Cons.</i> saith, <i>The Conscience, although erring, doth evermore bind, so as that
he sinneth who doth contrary to his Conscience,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> because he doth contrary to
the Will of God, although not materially and truly, yet formally and interpretatively</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_136_136" id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> Rom. 14. 23.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_137_137" id="Footnote_137_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> <i>i. e.</i> As he supposeth.</p></div>

<p>So the Question is <i>First</i>, <i>Whether the Civil Magistrate hath Power to
force Men in Things religious to do contrary to their Conscience; and if they
will not, to punish them in their Goods, Liberties, and Lives?</i> This we hold
in the Negative. But <i>Secondly</i>, As we would have the <i>Magistrate</i> to
avoid this Extreme of incroaching upon Men’s Consciences, so on the
other Hand we are far from joining with or strengthening such <i>Libertines</i>
as would stretch the Liberty of their Consciences to the Prejudice
of their <i>Neighbours</i>, or to the Ruin of <i>Human Society</i>. We understand
therefore by <i>Matters of Conscience</i> such as <i>immediately</i> relate
betwixt <i>God</i> and <i>Man</i>, or <i>Men</i> and <i>Men</i>, that are under the same
<i>Persuasion</i>, as to meet together and worship God in that Way which
they judge is most acceptable unto him, and not to incroach upon,
or seek to force their Neighbours, otherwise than by Reason, or such
other Means as Christ and his Apostles used, <i>viz.</i> Preaching and instructing
such as will hear and receive it; but not at all for Men,
under the Notion of Conscience, to do any Thing contrary to the
moral and perpetual Statutes generally acknowledged by all <i>Christians</i>;
in which Case the <i>Magistrate</i> may very lawfully use his Autho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a>[Pg 427]</span>rity;
as on those, who, under a Pretence of <i>Conscience</i>, make it a
Principle to kill and destroy all the Wicked, <i>id est</i>, all that differ from
them, that they, to wit, the <i>Saints</i>, may rule, and who therefore seek
to make all Things <i>common</i>, and would force their Neighbours to share
their Estates with them, and many such wild Notions, as is reported
of the <i>Anabaptists</i> of <i>Munster</i>; which evidently appears to proceed from
Pride and Covetousness, and not from Purity or Conscience; and
therefore I have sufficiently guarded against that in the latter Part of
the <i>Proposition</i>. But the <i>Liberty</i> we lay claim to is such as the <i>Primitive
Church</i> justly fought under the <i>Heathen Emperors</i>, to wit, for Men
of Sobriety, Honesty, and a peaceable Conversation, to enjoy the
Liberty and Exercise of their <i>Conscience</i> towards God and among
themselves, and to admit among them such as by their Persuasion and
Influence come to be convinced of the same <i>Truth</i> with them, without
being therefore molested by the Civil Magistrate. <i>Thirdly</i>, Though
we would not have Men hurt in their Temporals, nor robbed of
their Privileges as Men and Members of the <i>Commonwealth</i>, because of
their inward Persuasion; yet we are far from judging that in the
<i>Church of God</i> there should not be Censures exercised against such as
fall into Error, as well as such as commit open Evils; and therefore
we believe it may be very lawful for a <i>Christian Church</i>, if she find any
of her Members fall into any Error, after due Admonitions and Instructions
according to <i>Gospel Order</i>, if she find them pertinacious,
to <i>cut them off</i> from her Fellowship by the <i>Sword of the Spirit</i>, and deprive
them of those Privileges which they had as Fellow-members;
but not to cut them off from the World by the <i>temporal Sword</i>, or
rob them of their common Privileges as Men, seeing they enjoy not
these as Christians, or under such a Fellowship, but as Men, and
Members of the Creation. Hence <i>Chrysostom</i> saith well, (<i>de Anath.</i>)
<i>We must condemn and reprove the evil Doctrines that proceed from </i>Hereticks<i>;
but spare the Men, and pray for their Salvation</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3> But that no Man, by Virtue of any Power or Principality
he hath in the Government of this World, hath Power over the <i>Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a>[Pg 428]</span>sciences
of Men</i>, is apparent,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Conscience the Throne of God.</i></span>because <i>the Conscience of Man is the Seat
and Throne of God in him</i>, of which God is the alone <i>proper</i> and <i>infallible
Judge</i>, who by his Power and Spirit can alone rectify the Mistakes
of <i>Conscience</i>, and therefore hath reserved to himself the Power
of punishing the Errors thereof as he seeth meet. Now for the <i>Magistrate</i>
to assume this, is to take upon him to meddle with Things
not within the Compass of his Jurisdiction; for if this were within
the Compass of his Jurisdiction, he should be the proper Judge in
these Things; and also it were needful to him, as an essential Qualification
of his being a <i>Magistrate</i>, to be capable to judge in them.
But that the <i>Magistrate</i>, as a <i>Magistrate</i>, is neither proper Judge in
these Cases, nor yet that the Capacity so to be is requisite in him
as a <i>Magistrate</i>, our Adversaries cannot deny; or else they must say,
That all the <i>Heathen Magistrates</i> were either no <i>lawful Magistrates</i>, as
wanting something essential to Magistracy, and this were contrary to
the express Doctrine of the Apostle, <i>Rom.</i> xiii. or else (which is more
absurd) that those <i>Heathen Magistrates</i> were proper Judges in Matters
of <i>Conscience</i> among Christians. As for that Evasion that the <i>Magistrate</i>
ought to punish according to the Church Censure and Determination,
which is indeed no less than to make the <i>Magistrate</i> the
<i>Church’s Hangman</i>, we shall have Occasion to speak of it hereafter.
But if the chief Members of the <i>Church</i>, though ordained to inform,
instruct, and reprove, are not to have Dominion over the <i>Faith</i> nor
<i>Consciences</i> of the Faithful, as the Apostle expresly affirms, 2 <i>Cor.</i> i. 24.
then far less ought they to usurp this Dominion, or stir up the Magistrate
to persecute and murder those who cannot yield to them
therein.</div>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, This pretended Power of the <i>Magistrate</i> is both contrary
unto, and inconsistent with the Nature of the <i>Gospel</i>, which is a
Thing altogether extrinsick to the Rule and Government of <i>political
States</i>, as Christ expresly signified, saying, His <i>Kingdom</i> was <i>not of this
World</i>; and if the propagating of the <i>Gospel</i> had had any necessary
Relation thereunto, then Christ had not said so. But he abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a>[Pg 429]</span>
hath shewn by his Example, whom we are chiefly to <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: intimate">imitate</span> in
Matters of that Nature, that it is by <i>Persuasion</i> and the <i>Power of God</i>,
not by <i>Whips</i>, <i>Imprisonments</i>, <i>Banishments</i>, and <i>Murderings</i>, that the
Gospel is to be propagated; and that those that are the Propagators
of it are often to suffer by the Wicked, but never to cause the Wicked
to suffer. When he sends forth his Disciples, he tells them, he sends
them forth as <a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a><i>Lambs among Wolves</i>, to be willing to be <i>devoured</i>, not
to <i>devour</i>: He tells them of their being <i>whipped</i>, <i>imprisoned</i>, and <i>killed</i>
for their Conscience; but never that they shall either <i>whip</i>, <i>imprison</i>,
or <i>kill</i>: And indeed if <i>Christians</i> must be as <i>Lambs</i>, it is not the Nature
of <i>Lambs</i> to destroy or devour any. It serves nothing to allege, that
in Christ’s and his Apostles Times the <i>Magistrates</i> were <i>Heathens</i>, and
therefore Christ and his Apostles, nor yet any of the Believers, being
no <i>Magistrates</i>, could not exercise the Power; because it cannot be
denied but Christ, being the <i>Son of God</i>, had a true Right to all <i>Kingdoms</i>,
and was <i>righteous Heir</i> of the <i>Earth</i>. <a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><i>Next</i>, as to his <i>Power</i>, it
cannot be denied but he could, if he had seen meet, have called for
<i>Legions of Angels</i> to defend him, and have forced the <i>Princes</i> and <i>Potentates</i>
of the Earth to be subject unto him, <i>Matt.</i> xxvi. 53. So that it
was only because it was contrary to the Nature of <i>Christ</i>’s Gospel and
Ministry to use any Force or Violence in the gathering of Souls to
him. This he abundantly expressed in his Reproof to the two Sons
of <i>Zebedee</i>, who would have been calling for <i>Fire from Heaven</i> to burn
those that refused to receive Christ: It is not to be doubted but this
was as great a Crime as now to be in an Error concerning the Faith
and Doctrine of Christ. That there was not Power wanting to have
punished those Refusers of <i>Christ</i> cannot be doubted; for they that
could do other Miracles, might have done this also. And moreover,
they wanted not the Precedent of a holy Man under the Law,
as did <i>Elias</i>; yet we see what <i>Christ</i> saith to them, <i>Ye know not what Spirit
ye are of</i>, Luke ix. 55. <i>For the Son of Man is not come to destroy Men’s
Lives, but to save them</i>. Here Christ shews that such Kind of <i>Zeal</i> was
no Ways approved of him; and such as think to make Way for <i>Christ</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a>[Pg 430]</span>
or his <i>Gospel</i> by this Means, do not understand what <i>Spirit they are of</i>.
But if it was not lawful to call for <i>Fire from Heaven</i> to destroy such as
refuse to receive Christ, it is far less lawful to kindle <i>Fire upon Earth</i> to
destroy those that believe in Christ, because they will not believe, nor
can believe, as the Magistrates do, for Conscience Sake. And if it
was not lawful for the Apostles, who had so large a Measure of the
Spirit, and were so little liable to Mistake, to force others to their
Judgment, it can be far less lawful now for Men, who as Experience
declareth, and many of themselves confess, are fallible, and
often mistaken, to kill and destroy all such as cannot, because otherwise
persuaded in their Minds, judge and believe in Matters of Conscience
just as they do. And if it was not according to the Wisdom
of <i>Christ</i>, who was and is <i>King of Kings</i>, by outward Force to
constrain others to believe him or receive him, as being a Thing inconsistent
with the Nature of his <i>Ministry</i> and <i>spiritual Government</i>, do
not they grosly offend him, who will needs be wiser than he, and
think to force Men against their Persuasion to conform to their Doctrine
and Worship? The Word of the Lord said, <i>Not by Power and
by Might, but by the Spirit of the Lord</i>, Zech. iv. 6. But these say, <i>Not
by the Spirit of the Lord, but by Might and carnal Power</i>. The Apostle
saith plainly, <a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a><i>We wrestle not with Flesh and Blood</i>; and <i>the Weapons of
our Warfare are not carnal, but spiritual</i>: But these Men will needs
wrestle with Flesh and Blood, when they cannot prevail with
the Spirit and the Understanding; and not having spiritual Weapons,
go about with carnal Weapons to establish <i>Christ’s Kingdom</i>,
which they can never do: And therefore when the Matter is well
sifted, it is found to be more out of <i>Love to Self</i>, and from a Principle
of <i>Pride</i> in Man to have all others to bow to him, than from the
<i>Love of God</i>. <a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>Christ indeed takes another Method; for he saith, <i>He
will make his People a willing People in the Day of his Power</i>; but these
Men labour against Men’s Wills and Consciences, not by <i>Christ’s
Power</i>, but by the <i>outward Sword</i>, to make Men <i>the People of Christ</i>,
which they never can do, as shall hereafter be shewn.</p>

<p>But <i>Thirdly</i>, Christ fully and plainly declareth to us his Sense in
this Matter in the Parable of the <i>Tares</i>, Matt. xiii. of which we have
himself the Interpreter, <i>Ver.</i> 38, 39, 40, <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: 42">41</span>. where he expounds
them to be the <i>Children of the Wicked One</i>, and yet he will not have
the Servants to meddle with them, lest they pull up the <i>Wheat</i> therewith.
Now it cannot be denied but <i>Hereticks</i> are here included;
and although these Servants saw the <i>Tares</i>, and had a certain Discerning
of them; yet Christ would not they should meddle, lest
they should hurt the <i>Wheat</i>: Thereby intimating, That that Capacity
in Man <i>to be mistaken</i>, ought to be a Bridle upon him, to make
him wary in such Matters; and therefore, to prevent this Hurt, he
gives a positive Prohibition, <i>But he said, Nay</i>, Ver. 29. So that
they who will notwithstanding be pulling up that which they judge
is <i>Tares</i>, do openly declare, That they make no Scruple to break
the <i>Commands of Christ</i>. Miserable is that Evasion which some of our
Adversaries use here, in alleging these <i>Tares</i> are meant of <i>Hypocrites</i>,
and not of <i>Hereticks</i>! But how to evince that, seeing <i>Hereticks</i>, as
well as <i>Hypocrites</i>, are <i>Children of the Wicked One</i>, they have not
any Thing but their own bare Affirmation, which is therefore
justly rejected.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If they say, <i>Because Hypocrites cannot be discerned, but so may Hereticks</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>This is both false and a begging of the Question. For those that
have a <i>spiritual Discerning</i>, can discern both <i>Hypocrites</i> and <i>Hereticks</i>;
and those that want it, cannot certainly discern either. Seeing the
Question will arise, <i>Whether that is a Heresy which the Magistrate saith is
so</i>? And seeing it is both possible, and confessed by all to have often
fallen out, that some <i>Magistrates</i> have judged that <i>Heresy</i> which was
not, punishing Men accordingly for <i>Truth</i>, instead of <i>Error</i>; there
can be no Argument drawn from the Obviousness or Evidence of
<i>Heresy</i>, unless we should conclude <i>Heresy</i> could never be mistaken
for <i>Truth</i>, nor <i>Truth</i> for <i>Heresy</i>; whereof Experience shews daily the
contrary, even among Christians. But neither is this Shift ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>[Pg 432]</span>plicable
to this Place; for the Servants did discern the <i>Tares</i>, and
yet were liable to hurt the <i>Wheat</i>, if they had offered to pull
them up.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But they object against this <i>Liberty of Conscience</i>, Deut. xiii.
5. <i>Where false Prophets are appointed to be put to Death; and accordingly
they give Example thereof.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>The Case no Way holds parallel; those particular Commands to
the <i>Jews</i>, and Practices following upon them, are not a Rule for
<i>Christians</i>; else we might by the same Rule say, It were lawful for
us to borrow of our Neighbours their Goods, and so carry them
away, because the <i>Jews</i> did so by <i>God’s Command</i>; or that it is lawful
for <i>Christians</i> to invade their Neighbours Kingdoms, and cut them
all off without Mercy, because the <i>Jews</i> did so to the <i>Canaanites</i>, by
the Command of God.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If they urge, <i>That these Commands ought to stand, except they be repealed

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I say, The Precepts and Practices of Christ and his Apostles mentioned
are a sufficient Repeal: For if we should plead, That every

particular Repeal; then would it follow, That because it was lawful
for the <i>Jews</i>, if any Man killed one, for the nearest Kindred presently
to kill the Murderer, without any Order of Law, it were
lawful for us to do so likewise. And doth not this Command of
<i>Deut.</i> xiii. 9. openly order him who is enticed by another to forsake
the Lord, though it were his <i>Brother</i>, his <i>Son</i>, his <i>Daughter</i>, or his <i>Wife</i>,
presently to kill him or her? <i>Thou shalt surely kill him, thy Hand shall be
first upon him, to put him to Death.</i> If this Command were to be followed
there needed neither <i>Inquisition</i> nor <i>Magistrate</i> to do the Business;
and yet there is no Reason why they should shuffle by this Part, and
not the other; yea, to argue this Way from the Practice among the
<i>Jews</i>, were to overturn the very Gospel, and to set up again the
carnal Ordinances among the <i>Jews</i>, to pull down the spiritual Ones
of the <i>Gospel</i>. Indeed we can far better argue from the <i>Analogy</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a>[Pg 433]</span>twixt
the <i>figurative</i> and <i>carnal</i> State of the <i>Jews</i>, and the <i>real</i> and
<i>spiritual</i> One under the Gospel; that <i>as </i>Moses<i> delivered the </i>Jews<i> out of
outward </i>Egypt<i>, by an outward Force, and established them in an outward
Kingdom, by destroying their outward Enemies for them; so Christ, not by
overcoming outwardly, and killing others, but by suffering and being killed,
doth deliver his chosen ones, the inward </i>Jews<i>, out of mystical </i>Egypt<i>, destroying
their spiritual Enemies before them, and establishing among them his
spiritual Kingdom, which is not of this World. </i>And as<i> such as departed
from the Fellowship of outward </i>Israel<i> were to be cut off by the outward Sword,
so those that depart from the inward </i>Israel<i> are to be cut off by the Sword of
the Spirit: </i>For it answers very well<i>, That as the </i>Jews<i> were to cut off
their Enemies outwardly, in order to establish their Kingdom and outward
Worship, so they were to uphold it the same Way: </i>But<i> as the Kingdom and
Gospel of Christ was not to be established or propagated by cutting off or destroying
the </i>Gentiles<i>, but by persuading them, so neither is it to be upheld
otherwise.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But <i>Secondly</i>, they urge, <i>Rom.</i> xiii. where the <i>Magistrate</i> is said,
<i>Not to bear the Sword in vain, because he is the Minister of God, to
execute Wrath upon such as do Evil</i>. <i>But Heresy</i>, say they, <i>is Evil</i>.
Ergo.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But so is <i>Hypocrisy</i> also; yet they confess he ought not to punish
that. Therefore this must be understood of <i>moral Evils</i>, relative to
Affairs betwixt Man and Man, not of Matters of <i>Judgment</i> or <i>Worship</i>;
or else what great Absurdities would follow, considering that
<i>Paul</i> wrote here to the <i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i>, which was under the Government
of <i>Nero</i>, an impious <i>Heathen</i>, and <i>Persecutor</i> of the <i>Church</i>? Now
if a Power to punish in Point of <i>Heresy</i> be here included, it will necessarily
follow, That <i>Nero</i> had this Power; yea, and that he had
it of God; for because the <i>Power</i> was of God, therefore the Apostle
urges their Obedience. But can there be any Thing more absurd,
than to say that <i>Nero</i> had Power to judge in such Cases? Surely if
<i>Christian Magistrates</i> be not to punish for <i>Hypocrisy</i>, because they cannot
outwardly discern it; far less could <i>Nero</i> punish any Body for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a>[Pg 434]</span>
<i>Heresy</i>, which he was uncapable to discern. And if <i>Nero</i> had not
Power to judge or punish in Point of <i>Heresy</i>, then nothing can be
urged from this Place; since all that is said here, is spoken as applicable
to <i>Nero</i>, with a particular Relation to whom it was written.
And if <i>Nero</i> had such a Power, surely he was to exercise it
according to his Judgment and Conscience, and in doing thereof
he was not to be blamed; which is enough to justify him in his persecuting
of the Apostles, and murdering the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object that Saying of the Apostle to the <i>Galatians</i>,
v. 12. <i>I would they were even cut off which trouble you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>But how this imports any more than a <i>Cutting off from the Church</i>,
is not, nor can be shewn. <i>Beza</i> upon the Place saith, <i>We cannot understand
that otherwise than of Excommunication, such as was that of the incestuous
</i>Corinthian<i>. And indeed it is Madness to suppose it otherwise;
for </i>Paul<i> would not have these cut off otherwise than he did </i>Hymenæus<i> and
</i>Philetus<i>, who were Blasphemers; which was by giving them over to Satan,
not by cutting of their Heads.</i></p>

<p>The same Way may be answered that other Argument, drawn
from <i>Rev.</i> ii. 20. where the <i>Church of</i> Thyatira <i>is reproved for suffering
the Woman </i>Jezabel: Which can be no other Ways understood, than
that they did not <i>excommunicate</i> her, or cut her off by a <i>Church Censure</i>.
For as to Corporal Punishment, it is known that at that
Time the <i>Christians</i> had not Power to punish <i>Hereticks</i> so, if they had
had a Mind to it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They allege, That <i>Heresies are numbered among the Works
of the Flesh</i>, Gal. v. 20. <i>Ergo</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>That <i>Magistrates</i> have Power to punish all the Works of the Flesh,
is denied, and not yet proved. Every <i>Evil</i> is a Work of the Flesh,
but every <i>Evil</i> comes not under the Magistrate’s Cognizance. Is not
<i>Hypocrisy</i> a Work of the Flesh, which our Adversaries confess the
Magistrates ought not to punish? Yea, are not <i>Hatred</i> and <i>Envy</i>
there mentioned as Works of the <i>Flesh</i>? And yet the Magistrate
cannot punish them, as they are in themselves, until they exert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a>[Pg 435]</span>
themselves in other Acts which come under his Power. But so
long as <i>Heresy</i> doth not exert itself in any Act destructive to <i>human
Society</i>, or such like Things, but is kept within the Sphere of those
Duties of <i>Doctrine</i> or <i>Worship</i> which stand betwixt a Man and God,
they no Ways come under the Magistrate’s Power.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> But <i>Secondly</i>, This Forcing of Men’s Consciences is contrary
to <i>sound Reason</i>, and the very <i>Law of Nature</i>. For Man’s Understanding
cannot be forced by all the Bodily Sufferings another Man can
inflict upon him, especially in Matters spiritual and supernatural: <i>It
is Argument, and evident Demonstration of Reason, together with the Power of
God reaching the Heart, that can change a Man’s Mind from one Opinion
to another, and not Knocks and Blows, and such like Things, which may
indeed destroy the Body, but never can inform the Soul, which is a free Agent,
and must either accept or reject Matters of Opinion as they are borne in upon
it by something proportioned to its own Nature</i>. To seek to force Minds
in any other Manner, is to deal with Men as if they were Brutes,
void of Understanding; and at last is but to lose one’s Labour, and
as the Proverb is, <i>To seek to wash the Black-moor white</i>. By that Course
indeed Men may be made <i>Hypocrites</i>, but can never be made <i>Christians</i>;
and surely the Products of such <i>Compulsion</i> (even where the
End is obtained, to wit, an outward Assent or Conformity, whether
in <i>Doctrine</i> or <i>Worship</i>) can be no Ways acceptable to God,
who desireth not any Sacrifice, except that which cometh throughly
from the Heart, and will have no constrained ones: So that Men,
by constraining Force, are so far from being Members of the <i>Church</i>,
that they are made ten Times more the Servants of Satan than before;
in that to their <i>Error</i> is added <i>Hypocrisy</i>, the worst of <i>Evils</i> in
Matters of Religion, and that which above all Things the Lord’s
Soul most abhors.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But if it be said, <i>Their Error notwithstanding is thereby suppressed, and
the Scandal removed</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, Besides that this is a Method no Ways allowed by Christ,
as is above proved, surely the Church can be no Ways bettered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a>[Pg 436]</span>
the Accession of <i>Hypocrites</i>, but greatly corrupted and endangered;
for open <i>Heresies</i> Men may be aware of, and shun such as profess
them, when they are separated from the Church by her Censures:
But secret <i>Hypocrites</i> may putrefy the Body, and leaven it, ere Men
be aware. And if the Dissenters prove resolute, and suffer boldly
for the Opinions they esteem right, Experience sheweth that such
Sufferings often tend to the Commendation of the Sufferers, but
never of the Persecutors. For such Suffering ordinarily breeds
Compassion, and begets a Curiosity in others to enquire the more
diligently into the Things for which they see Men <i>suffer</i> such great
<i>Losses</i> so boldly; and is also able to beget an Opinion, that it is for
some Good they do so suffer: It being no Ways probable that Men
will venture all merely to acquire Fame; which may as well be
urged to detract from the Reputation of all the <i>Martyrs</i>, unless some
better Arguments be brought against it than a <i>Halter</i> or a <i>Faggot</i>.
But supposing this Principle, <i>That the Magistrate hath Power to force
the Consciences of his Subjects, and to punish them if they will not comply</i>,
very great Inconveniences and Absurdities will follow, and even
such as are inconsistent with the Nature of the <i>Christian Religion</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>First</i>, It will naturally follow, That the Magistrate ought to
do it, and sinneth by Omission of his Duty, if he do it not. Will
it not then hence be inferred that Christ was defective to his Church,
who having Power to force Men, and to call for <i>Legions of Angels</i>
so to do, did notwithstanding not exert that Power, but left his
Church to the Mercy of the Wicked, without so necessary a Bulwark?</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Seeing every Magistrate is to exercise his Power according
to the best Understanding he hath, being obliged so to do, for
the Promoting of what he in Conscience is persuaded to be Truth,
will not this justify all the <i>Heathen Emperors</i> in their Persecutions
against <i>Christians</i>? Will not this justify the <i>Spanish Inquisition</i>, which
yet is odious, not only to <i>Protestants</i>, but to many moderate <i>Papists</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a>[Pg 437]</span>
How can <i>Protestants</i> in Reason condemn the <i>Papists</i> for persecuting
them, seeing they do but exercise a <i>lawful Power</i> according to their
<i>Conscience</i> and best Understanding, and do no more to them than
the Sufferers profess they would do to them, if they were in the
like Capacity? Which takes away all Ground of Commiseration
from the Sufferers: Whereas that was the Ground which of old
gained Reputation to the <i>Christians</i>, that they being innocent, <i>suffered</i>,
who neither had, nor by Principle could, hurt any. But
there is little Reason to pity one that is but dealt by according as
he would deal with others. For to say, <i>They have no Reason to persecute
us, because they are in the Wrong, and we in the Right</i>, is but miserably
to beg the Question. Doth not this Doctrine strengthen
the Hands <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: of the Persecutors">of Persecutors</span> every where, and that rationally,
from a Principle of Self-preservation? For who can blame me for
destroying him that I know waits but for an Occasion to destroy
me, if he could? Yea, this makes all Suffering for <i>Religion</i>, which
of old was the Glory of <i>Christians</i>, to be but of pure Necessity;
whereby they are not led as <i>Lambs to the Slaughter</i>, as was the <i>Captain
of their Salvation</i>; but rather as <i>Wolves</i> catched in the Snare, who
only bite not again because they are not able; but could they get
Force, would be as ready to lead those the same Way that led them.
Where is the Faith and Patience of the Saints? For indeed it is but
a small Glory to make a Virtue of Necessity, and suffer because I
cannot help it. Every Thief and Murderer would be a <i>Martyr</i> at
that Rate: Experience hath abundantly proved this in these last
<i>Centuries</i>; for however each Party talk of <i>positively</i> obeying the <i>Magistrate</i>
in such Cases, and that the Power resides in him, yet it is
apparent, that from this Principle it naturally follows, That any
Party, supposing themselves right, should, so soon as they are able,
endeavour at any Rate to get uppermost, that they might bring under
those of another Opinion, and force the <i>Magistrate</i> to uphold their
Way, to the Ruin of all others. What Engine the <i>Pope</i> of <i>Rome</i>
used to make of his pretended Power in this Thing, upon any Pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a>[Pg 438]</span>tence
of Dislike to any Prince or State, even for very small Heresies
in their own Account, to depose Princes, and set up their Subjects
against them, and give their Dominions to other Princes to serve
his Interest, they cannot be ignorant who have read the Life of
<i>Hildebrand</i>; and how <i>Protestants</i> have vindicated the Liberty of their
Consciences after this same Manner is apparent. They suffered
much in <i>France</i>, to the great Increase and Advantage of their Party;
but as soon as they found themselves considerable, and had gotten
some Princes upon their Side, they began to let the King know, That
they must either have the Liberty of their Consciences, or else they
would purchase it; not by suffering, but by fighting. And the
Experience of other <i>Protestant States</i> shews, That if <i>Henry</i> the 4th, to
please the <i>Papists</i>, had not quitted his Religion, to get the Crown
the more peaceably, and so the <i>Protestants</i> had prevailed with the
Sword, they would as well have taught the <i>Papists</i> with the Faggot,
and led them to the Stake: So that this Principle of <i>Persecution</i> on
all Hands is the Ground of all those Miseries and Contentions.
For so long as any Party is persuaded that it is both lawful for
them, and their Duty, if in Power, to destroy those that differ
from them, it naturally follows they ought to use all Means possible
to get that Power, whereby they may secure themselves in the Ruin
of their Adversaries. And that <i>Papists</i> judge it not unlawful to compel
the Magistrate, if they be strong enough to do it, to effect this.
Experience shews it to be a known <i>Popish</i> Principle, That <i>the Pope
may depose an Heretick Prince, and absolve the People from the Oath of Fidelity</i>:
And the <i>Pope</i>, as is above said, hath done so to divers Princes;
and this Doctrine is defended by <i>Bellarmine</i> against <i>Barclay</i>. The
<i>French</i> refused <i>Henry</i> the Fourth till he quitted his Religion. And
as for <i>Protestants</i>, many of them scruple not to affirm, <i>That wicked
Kings and Magistrates may be deposed, and killed</i>: Yea, our <i>Scotch Presbyterians</i>
are as positive in it as any <i>Jesuits</i>, who would not admit King
<i>Charles</i> the Second, though otherwise a <i>Protestant Prince</i>, unless he
would swear to renounce <i>Episcopacy</i>; a Matter of no great Difference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a>[Pg 439]</span>
though contrary to his Conscience. Now how little Proportion
these Things bear with the Primitive Christians, and the Religion
propagated by Christ and his Apostles, needs no great Demonstration;
and it is observable, that notwithstanding many other Superstitions
crept into the Church very early, yet this of <i>Persecution</i> was
so inconsistent with the Nature of the Gospel, and Liberty of Conscience,
as we have asserted it, such an innate and natural Part of
the Christian Religion, that almost all the <i>Christian Writers</i>, for the
first three hundred Years, earnestly contended for it, condemning
the contrary Opinion.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Athan.<i> in Epist. ad </i>Solit. vit. Ag.<i> ibid.</i></span>Thus <i>Athanasius</i>; “It is the Property of Piety not to force,
but to persuade, in Imitation of our Lord, who forced no Body,
but left it to the Will of every one to follow him, <i>&amp;c.</i> But the
Devil, because he hath nothing of Truth, uses Knocks and Axes,
to break up the Doors of such as receive him. But our Saviour
is meek, teaching the Truth; whosoever will come after
me, and whosoever will be my Disciple, <i>&amp;c.</i> but constraining
none; coming to us, and knocking rather, and saying, My Sister,
my Spouse open to me, <i>&amp;c.</i> And entereth when he is opened
to, and retires if they delay, and will not open unto him; because
it is not with Swords, nor Darts, nor Soldiers, nor Armour,
that Truth is to be declared, but with Persuasion and Counsel.”
And it is observable, That they were the impious <i>Arians</i> who first of
all brought in this Doctrine, to persecute others among Christians,
whose Successors both <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> are in this Matter, whom
<i>Athanasius</i> thus reproveth further:
<span class="sidenote">Athan. <i>Apol. 1 de Fuga Sua, Tom. 1.</i></span>“Where (saith he) have they
learned to persecute? Certainly they cannot say they have learned
it from the Saints; but this hath been given them, and taught
them of the Devil. The Lord commanded indeed sometimes to
flee, and the Saints sometimes fled; but to persecute is the Invention
and Argument of the Devil, which he seeks against all.”
And after he saith, “In so far as the <i>Arians</i> banish those that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a>[Pg 440]</span>

and Prisons, and forceth herself to be believed, which once
was believed because of the Imprisonments and Banishments herself
suffered. She that once was consecrated by the Terrors of her
Persecutors, depends now upon the Dignity of those that are in

<p>Now how either <i>Papists</i> or <i>Protestants</i>, that boast of Antiquity, can
get by these plain Testimonies, let any rational Man judge. And
indeed I much question if in any one Point owned by them, and denied
by us, they can find all the <i>old Fathers</i> and <i>Writers</i> so exactly
unanimous. Which shews how contrary all of them judged this to
be to the Nature of Christianity, and that in the Point of <i>Persecution</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a>[Pg 442]</span>
lay no small Part of the Apostasy; which, from little to more, came
to that, <i>That the </i>Pope<i>, upon every small Discontent, would excommunicate
Princes, absolve their Subjects from obeying them, and turn them in and out
at his Pleasure</i>. Now if <i>Protestants</i> do justly abhor these Things among
Papists, is it not sad that they should do the like themselves? A Thing
that at their first Appearance, when they were in their primitive
Innocency, they did not think on, as appears by that Saying of

him most fit?</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>History of the Council of </i>Trent.</span>He answered, <i>The Counsel that </i>Gamaliel<i> proposed to the
Jews, </i>to wit<i>, That if this Design was of God, it would stand; if not, it
would vanish; which he said ought to content the Pope</i>: He did not say,
<i>Because he was in the Right he ought to be spared</i>. For this <i>Counsel</i> supposeth,
That those that are tolerated may be wrong; and yet how
soon did the same <i>Luther</i>, ere he was well secure himself, press the
Elector of <i>Saxony</i> to banish poor <i>Carolostadius</i>, because he could not
in all Things submit to his Judgment? And certainly it is not without
Ground reported, That it smote <i>Luther</i> to the Heart; so that
he needed to be comforted, when he was informed, That <i>Carolostadius</i>,
in his Letter to his Congregation, stiled himself, <i>A Man banished
for Conscience, by the Procurement of</i> Martin Luther. And since both
the <i>Lutherans</i> and <i>Calvinists</i> not admitting one another to worship in
those respective Dominions, sheweth how little better they are than
either <i>Papists</i> or <i>Arians</i> in this Particular. <a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>And yet <i>Calvin</i> saith, That
<i>the Conscience is free from the Power of all Men</i>: If so, why then did he
cause <i>Castellio</i> to be banished because he could not, for <i>Conscience Sake</i>,
believe as he did, <i>That God had ordained Men to be damned</i>? And <i>Ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a>[Pg 443]</span>vetus</i>
to be burned for denying the <i>Divinity of Christ</i>? if <i>Calvin</i>’s Report
of him be to be credited? Which Opinion, though indeed it
was to be abominated, yet no less was <i>Calvin</i>’s Practice in causing
him to be burned, and afterwards defending that it was lawful to
burn <i>Hereticks</i>; by which he encouraged the <i>Papists</i> to lead his Followers
the more confidently to the Stake, as having for their Warrant
the Doctrine of their own <i>Sect-master</i>; which they omitted not
frequently to twit them with, and indeed it was to them unanswerable.
Hence, upon this Occasion, the judicious Author of the
<i>History of the Council of Trent</i>, in his <i>fifth Book</i>, where giving an Account
of several <i>Protestants</i> that were burned for their Religion,
well and wisely observeth it, <i>as a Matter of Astonishment, that those of
the New Reformation did offer to punish in the Case of Religion</i>. And afterwards,
taking Notice that <i>Calvin</i> justifies the Punishing of <i>Hereticks</i>,
he adds, <i>But since the Name of </i>Heresy<i> may be more or less restricted,
yea, or diversly taken, this Doctrine may be likewise taken in divers Senses,
and may at one Time hurt those, whom at another Time it may have benefited</i>.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ground of Persecution.</i></span>Now the <i>Ground of Persecution</i>, as hath been above shewn,
is an <i>Unwillingness to suffer</i>; for no Man, that will persecute another
for his <i>Conscience</i>, would suffer for his own, if he could avoid it,
seeing his Principle obliges him, if he had Power, by Force to
establish that which he judges is the <i>Truth</i>, and so to force others to
it. Therefore I judge it meet, for the Information of the Nations,
briefly to add something in this Place concerning the <i>Nature of true
Christian Sufferings</i>, whereunto a very faithful Testimony hath been
borne by <i>God’s Witnesses</i>, which he hath raised up in this Age, beyond
what hath been generally known or practised for these many
Generations, yea, since the Apostasy took Place. Yet it is not my
Design here in any wise to derogate from the Sufferings of the
<i>Protestant Martyrs</i>, whom I believe to have walked in Faithfulness towards
God, according to the Dispensation of <i>Light</i> in that Day appearing,
and of which many were utter Enemies to <i>Persecution</i>, as by
their Testimonies against it might be made appear.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>What true Suffering is.</i></span>But the true, faithful and Christian Suffering is <i>for Men to profess
what they are persuaded is right, and so practise and perform their Worship
towards God, as being their true Right so to do; and neither to do more in
that, because of outward Encouragement from Men; nor any Whit less, because
of the Fear of their Laws and Acts against it</i>. Thus for a Christian
Man to vindicate his just Liberty with so much Boldness, and yet
Innocency, will in due Time, though through Blood, purchase
Peace; as this Age hath in some Measure experienced, and many
are Witnesses of it; which yet shall be more apparent to the World,
as <i>Truth</i> takes Place in the Earth. But they greatly sin against this
excellent Rule, that in Time of <i>Persecution</i> do not profess their own
Way so much as they would if it were otherwise; and yet, when they
can get the Magistrate upon their Side, not only stretch their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a>[Pg 445]</span>
Liberty to the utmost, but seek to establish the same by denying
it to others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The innocent Sufferings of the People called </i>Quakers.</span>But of this excellent Patience and Sufferings, the Witnesses of
God, in Scorn called <i>Quakers</i>, have given a manifest Proof: For so
soon as God revealed his <i>Truth</i> among them, without Regard to
any Opposition whatsoever, or what they might meet with, they
went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and
propagating the <i>Truth</i> in Market-places, Highways, Streets, and
publick Temples, though daily beaten, whipped, bruised, haled,
and imprisoned therefore. And when there was any where a Church
or Assembly gathered, they taught them to keep their Meetings
openly, and not to shut the Door, nor do it by Stealth, that all
might know it, and those who would might enter. And as hereby
all just Occasion of Fear of Plotting against the Government was
fully removed, so this their Courage and Faithfulness in not giving
over their Meeting together (but more especially the Presence and
Glory of God manifested in the Meeting being terrible to the Consciences
of the Persecutors) did so weary out the Malice of their Adversaries,
that oftentimes they were forced to leave their Work undone.
For when they came to break up a Meeting, they were
obliged to take every Individual out by Force, they not being free
to give up their Liberty by dissolving at their Command: And
when they were haled out, unless they were kept forth by Violence,
they presently returned peaceably to their Place. Yea, when sometimes
the Magistrates have pulled down their Meeting-houses, they
have met the next Day openly upon the Rubbish, and so by Innocency
kept their Possession and Ground, being properly their own,
and their Right to meet and worship God being not forfeited to
any. So that when armed Men have come to dissolve them, it was
impossible for them to do it, unless they had killed every one; for
they stood so close together, that no Force could move any one to
stir, until violently pulled thence: So that when the Malice of their
Opposers stirred them to take Shovels, and throw the Rubbish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a>[Pg 446]</span>
upon them, there they stood unmoved, being willing, if the Lord
should so permit, to have been there buried alive, witnessing for
him. As this patient but yet courageous Way of Suffering made the
Persecutors Work very heavy and wearisome unto them, so the Courage
and Patience of the Sufferers, using no Resistance, nor bringing
any Weapons to defend themselves, nor seeking any Ways Revenge
upon such Occasions, did secretly smite the Hearts of the
Persecutors, and made their Chariot-wheels go on heavily. Thus
after much and many kind of Sufferings thus patiently borne, which
to rehearse would make a Volume of itself, which may in due Time
be published to the Nations (for we have them upon Record) a Kind
of <i>negative Liberty</i> has been obtained; so that at present, for the most
Part, we meet together without Disturbance from the Magistrate.
But on the contrary, most <i>Protestants</i>, when they have not the Allowance
and Toleration of the Magistrate, meet only in Secret, and
hide their Testimony; and if they be discovered, if there be any
Probability of making their Escape by Force (or suppose it were by
cutting off those that seek them out) they will do it; whereby they
lose the Glory of their Sufferings, by not appearing as the innocent
Followers of Christ, nor having a Testimony of their Harmlesness
in the Hearts of their Pursuers, their Fury, by such Resistance, is
the more kindled against them. As to this last Part, of resisting such
as persecute them, they can lay Claim to no Precept from Christ,
nor any Example of him or his Apostles approved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>But as to the first Part, for fleeing and meeting secretly, and not
openly testifying for the Truth, they usually object that Saying of
Christ, Matt. x. 23. <i>When they persecute you in this City, flee ye into another.</i>
And <i>Acts</i> ix. 4. <i>That the Disciples met secretly for fear of the Jews.</i>
And <i>Acts</i> ix. 25. <i>That </i>Paul<i> was let out of </i>Damascus<i> in a Basket down by
the Wall.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>To all which I <i>answer</i>, <i>First</i>, As to that Saying of Christ, it is a
Question if it had any further Relation than to that particular Message
with which he sent them to the <i>Jews</i>; Yea, the latter End of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a>[Pg 447]</span>
the Words seems expresly to hold forth so much; <i>For ye shall not have
gone over the Cities of </i>Israel<i> till the Son of Man be come</i>. Now a particular
Practice or Command for a particular Time will not serve for
a Precedent to any at this Day to shun the Cross of Christ. But
supposing this Precept to reach farther, it must be so understood to
be made use of only according as the Spirit giveth Liberty, else no
Man that could flee might suffer Persecution.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Fleeing in Time of Persecution not allowed</i>.</span>How then did not
the Apostles <i>John</i> and <i>Peter</i> flee, when they were the first Time persecuted
at <i>Jerusalem</i>? But, on the contrary, went the next Day, after
they were discharged by the Council, and preached boldly to the
People. But indeed many are but too capable to stretch such Sayings
as these for Self-preservation, and therefore have great Ground
to fear, when they interpret them, that they shun to witness for
Christ, for fear of Hurt to themselves, lest they mistake them. As
for that private Meeting of the Disciples, we have only an Account
of the Matter of Fact, but that suffices not to make of it a Precedent
for us; and Men’s Aptness to imitate them in that (which, for aught
we know, might have been an Act of Weakness) and not in other
Things of a contrary Nature, shews that it is not a true Zeal to be
like those Disciples, but indeed a Desire to preserve themselves, which
moves them so to do. <i>Lastly</i>, As to that of <i>Paul</i>’s being conveyed out
of <i>Damascus</i>, the Case was singular, and is not to be doubted but it
was done by a special Allowance from God, who having designed
him to be a principal Minister of his Gospel, saw meet in his Wisdom
to disappoint the wicked Counsel of the <i>Jews</i>. But our Adversaries
have no such Pretext for <i>fleeing</i>, whose <i>Fleeing</i> proceeds from
Self-preservation, not from immediate Revelation. And that <i>Paul</i>
made not this the Method of his Procedure, appears, in that at another
Time, notwithstanding the Persuasion of his Friends, and certain
Prophecies of his Sufferings to come, he would not be dissuaded
from going up to <i>Jerusalem</i>, which according to the forementioned
Rule he should have done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a>[Pg 448]</span></p>

<p>But <i>Lastly</i>, To conclude this Matter, Glory to God, and our Lord
Jesus Christ, that now these <i>twenty-five Years</i>, since we were known
to be a distinct and separate People, hath given us faithfully to suffer
for his <i>Name</i>, without shrinking or fleeing the Cross; and what
Liberty we now enjoy, it is by his Mercy, and not by any outward
Working or Procuring of our own, but it is He has wrought upon
the Hearts of our Opposers. Nor was it any outward Interest hath
procured it unto us, but the Testimony of our Harmlesness in the
Hearts of our Superiors: For God hath preserved us hitherto in the
<i>patient Suffering of Jesus</i>, that we have not given away our Cause by
persecuting any, which few if any Christians that I know can say.
Now against our unparalleled yet innocent and Christian Cause our
malicious Enemies have nothing to say, But that if we had Power,
we would do so likewise. This is a Piece of mere unreasonable Malice,
and a Privilege they take to judge of Things to come, which they
have not by immediate Revelation; and surely it is the greatest
Height of harsh Judgment to say Men would do contrary to their
<i>professed Principle</i> if they could, who have from their Practice hitherto
given no Ground for it, and wherein they only judge others by
themselves: Such Conjectures cannot militate against us, so long as
we are innocent. And if ever we prove guilty of <i>Persecution</i>, by
forcing other Men by corporal Punishment to our Way, then let us
be judged the greatest of <i>Hypocrites</i>, and let not any spare to <i>persecute</i>
us. <i>Amen, saith my Soul.</i></p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. I.</h3> Having hitherto treated of the Principles of Religion,
both relating to <i>Doctrine</i> and <i>Worship</i>, I am now to speak
of some Practices which have been the Product of this <i>Principle</i>, in
those Witnesses whom God hath raised up in this Day to testify for
his <i>Truth</i>. It will not a little commend them, I suppose, in the
Judgment of sober and judicious Men, that taking them generally,
even by the Confession of their Adversaries, they are found to be
free of those Abominations which abound among other Professors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a>[Pg 450]</span>
such as are <i>Swearing</i>, <i>Drunkenness</i>, <i>Whoredom</i>, <i>Riotousness</i>, &amp;c. and that
generally the very Coming among <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: those">this</span> People doth naturally work
such a Change, so that many vicious and profane Persons have been
known, by coming to this <i>Truth</i>, to become sober and virtuous;
and many light, vain, and wanton Ones to become grave and serious,
as our Adversaries dare not deny:<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet that they may not
want something to detract us for, cease not to accuse us for those
Things which, when found among themselves, they highly commend;
thus our <i>Gravity</i> they call <i>Sullenness</i>, our <i>Seriousness</i>, <i>Melancholy</i>,
our <i>Silence</i>, <i>Sottishness</i>. Such as have been vicious and profane
among them, but by coming to us have left off those Evils,
lest they should commend the Truth of our Profession, they say,
That whereas they were profane before, they are become worse,
<i>In being hypocritical and spiritually proud</i>. If any before <i>dissolute</i> and
<i>profane</i> among them, by coming to the Truth with us, become
<i>frugal</i> and <i>diligent</i>, then they will charge them with <i>Covetousness</i>:
And if any <i>eminent</i> among them for <i>Seriousness</i>, <i>Piety</i>, and <i>Discoveries
of God</i>, come unto us, then they will say, They were always subject
to <i>Melancholy</i> and to <i>Enthusiasm</i>; though before, when among
them, it was esteemed neither <i>Melancholy</i> nor <i>Enthusiasm</i> in an evil
Sense, but <i>Christian Gravity</i> and <i>Divine Revelation</i>. Our <i>Boldness</i> and
<i>Christian Suffering</i> they call <i>Obstinacy</i> and <i>Pertinacy</i>; though half as
much, if among themselves, they would account <i>Christian Courage</i>
and <i>Nobility</i>. And though thus by their Envy they strive to read
all relating to us backwards, counting those Things Vices in us,
which in themselves they would extol as Virtues, yet hath the
Strength of Truth extorted this Confession often from them, <i>That we
are generally a pure and clean People, as to the outward Conversation</i>.</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> After this Manner the <i>Papists</i> used to disapprove the Sobriety of the <i>Waldenses</i>, of whom
<i>Reinerius</i>, a Popish Author, so writeth. “But this Sect of the <i>Leonists</i> hath a great Shew of Truth;
for that they live righteously before Men, and believe all Things well of God, and all the
Articles which are contained in the Creed; only they blaspheme and hate the Church of
<i>Rome</i>.”</p></div>

<p><i>But this, </i>they say<i>, is but in Policy to commend our Heresy.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a>[Pg 451]</span></p>

<p>But such Policy it is, say I, as Christ and his Apostles made use
of, and all good Christians ought to do; yea, so far hath Truth
prevailed by the Purity of its Followers, that if one that is called a
<i>Quaker</i> do but that which is common among them, as to <i>laugh</i> and
be <i>wanton</i>, <i>speak at large</i>, and keep not his <i>Word</i> punctually, or be
overtaken with <i>Hastiness</i> or <i>Anger</i>, they presently say, <i>O this is against
your Profession!</i> As if indeed so to do were very consistent with
theirs; wherein though they speak the Truth, yet they give away
their Cause. But if they can find any under our Name in any
of those Evils common among themselves (as who can imagine but
among so many Thousands there will be some Chaff, since of twelve
Apostles one was found to be a Devil) O how will they insult, and
make more Noise of the Escape of one <i>Quaker</i>, than of an hundred
among themselves!</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. II.</h3> But there are some singular Things, which most of all our
Adversaries plead for the Lawfulness of, and allow themselves in,
as no Ways inconsistent with the <i>Christian Religion</i>, which we have
found to be no Ways lawful unto us, and have been commanded
of the Lord to lay them aside; though the doing thereof hath occasioned
no small Sufferings and Buffetings, and hath procured us
much Hatred and Malice from the World. And because the Nature
of these Things is such, that they do upon the very Sight distinguish
us, and make us known, so that we cannot hide ourselves
from any, without proving unfaithful to our Testimony; our Trials
and Exercises have herethrough proved the more numerous and
difficult, as will after appear. These I have laboured briefly to
comprehend in this Proposition; but they may more largely be exhibited
in these six following Propositions.</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="sidenote">Flattering Titles.</span>I. <i>That it is not lawful to give to Men such flattering Titles, as Your Holiness,
Your Majesty, Your Eminency, Your Excellency, Your Grace, Your
Lordship, Your Honour, </i>&amp;c.<i> nor use those flattering Words, commonly
called</i> [<span class="smcap">Compliments</span>.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a>[Pg 452]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hat and Knee.</span>II. <i>That it is not lawful for Christians to kneel, or prostrate themselves to
any Man, or to bow the Body, or to uncover the Head to them.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Apparel.</span>III. <i>That it is not lawful for <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally Christian">Christians</span> to use Superfluities in Apparel,
as are of no Use, save for Ornament and Vanity.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Gaming.</span>IV. <i>That it is not lawful to use Games, Sports, Plays, nor among other
Things Comedies among Christians, under the Notion of Recreations, which
do not agree with Christian Silence, Gravity, and Sobriety: For Laughing,
Sporting, Gaming, Mocking, Jesting, vain Talking, </i>&amp;c.<i> is not Christian
Liberty, nor harmless Mirth.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Swearing.</span>V. <i>That it is not lawful for Christians to swear at all under the Gospel,
not only not vainly, and in their common Discourse, which was also forbidden
under the </i>Mosaical<i> Law, but even not in Judgment before the Magistrate.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fighting.</span>VI. <i>That it is not lawful for Christians to resist Evil, or to war or fight in
any Case.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sidenote"><i>Degrees of Dignity and Precedency allowed.</i></span>Before I enter upon a particular Disquisition of these Things, I
shall first premise some general Considerations, to prevent all Mistakes;
and next add some general Considerations, which equally
respect all of them. I would not have any judge, That hereby
we intend to destroy the <i>mutual Relation</i> that either is betwixt <i>Prince</i>
and <i>People</i>, <i>Master</i> and <i>Servants</i>, <i>Parents</i> and <i>Children</i>; nay, not at
all: We shall evidence, That our Principle in these Things hath no
such Tendency, and that these natural Relations are rather better
established, than any Ways hurt by it. Next, Let not any judge,
That from our Opinion in these Things, any Necessity of <i>levelling</i>
will follow, or that all Men must have Things in <i>common</i>. Our
Principle leaves every Man to enjoy that peaceably, which either
his own Industry, or his Parents, have purchased to him; only he
is thereby instructed to use it aright, both for his own Good, and
that of his Brethren; and all to the Glory of God: In which also
his Acts are to be <i>voluntary</i>, and no Ways <i>constrained</i>. And further,
we say not hereby, that no Man may use the Creation more or less
than another: For we know, That as it hath pleased God to dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a>[Pg 453]</span>pense
it diversly, giving to some more, and some less, so they may
use it accordingly.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Education differs accordingly.</i></span>The several Conditions, under which Men are
diversly stated, together with their Educations answering thereunto,
do sufficiently shew this: The <i>Servant</i> is not the same Way educated
as the <i>Master</i>; nor the <i>Tenant</i> as the <i>Landlord</i>; nor the <i>Rich</i> as
the <i>Poor</i>; nor the <i>Prince</i> as the <i>Peasant</i>. Now, though it be not
lawful for any, however great Abundance they may have, or whatever
their Education may be, to use that which is merely superfluous;
yet seeing their Education has accustomed them thereunto,
and their Capacity enables them so to do, without being profuse
or extravagant, they may use Things better in their Kind, than
such whose <i>Education</i> hath neither accustomed them to such Things,
nor their Capacity will reach to compass them.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The lawful or unlawful Use of the Creation.</i></span>For it is beyond
Question, That whatever Thing the <i>Creation</i> affords is for the Use
of Man, and the moderate Use of them is lawful; yet, <i>per accidens</i>,
they may be unlawful to some, and not to others. As for Instance,
He that by Reason of his Estate and Education hath been used to
eat <i>Flesh</i> and drink <i>Wine</i>, and to be clothed with the <i>finest Wool</i>,
if his Estate will bear it, and he use it neither in Superfluity, nor
immoderately, he may do it; and perhaps, if he should apply
himself to feed, or be cloathed as are the Peasants, it might prejudice
the Health of his Body, and nothing advance his Soul. But
if a Man, whose Estate and Education had accustomed him to both
<i>coarser Food</i> and <i>Raiment</i>, should stretch himself beyond what he
had, or were used to, to the manifest Prejudice of his Family and
Children, no Doubt it would be unlawful to him, even so to eat
or be clothed as another, in whom it is lawful; for that the other
may be as much mortified, and have denied himself as much in
coming down to that, which this aspires to, as he, in willing to
be like him, aspires beyond what he either is able, or hath accustomed
to do. The safe Place then is, for such as have Fulness, to
watch over themselves, that they use it moderately, and rescind all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a>[Pg 454]</span>
Superfluities;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Rich to help the Poor.</i></span>being willing, as far as they can, to help the Need of
those to whom Providence hath allotted a smaller Allowance. <i>Let the
Brother of high Degree rejoice, in that he is abased; and such as God calls
in a low Degree, be content with their Condition, not envying those Brethren
who have greater Abundance, </i>knowing<i> they have received Abundance, as
to the inward Man</i>; which is chiefly to be regarded. And therefore
beware of such a Temptation, as to use their Calling as an Engine
to be <i>richer</i>, knowing, they have this Advantage beyond the <i>Rich</i>
and <i>Noble</i> that are called, that the Truth doth not any Ways abase
them, nay, not in the Esteem of the World, as it <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: doth in the">doth the</span> other;
but that they are rather exalted thereby, in that as to the inward
and spiritual Fellowship of the Saints, they become the Brethren
and Companions of the greatest and richest; and in this Respect,
<i>Let him of low Degree rejoice that he is exalted</i>.</p>

<p>These Things premised, I would seriously propose unto all such,
as choose to be <i>Christians</i> indeed, and that in <i>Nature</i>, and not in
<i>Name</i> only, whether it were not desirable, and would not greatly
contribute to the Commendation of <i>Christianity</i>, and to the Increase
of the Life and Virtue of Christ, if <i>all superfluous Titles of Honour, Profuseness
and Prodigality in Meat and Apparel, Gaming, Sporting and Playing</i>,
were laid aside and forborn? And whether such as lay them
aside, in so doing, walk not more like the Disciples of Christ and
his Apostles, and are therein nearer their Example, than such as
use them? Whether the laying them aside would hinder any from
being good Christians? Or if Christians might not be better without
them, than with them? Certainly the <i>Sober</i> and <i>Serious</i> among
all Sorts will say, <i>Yea</i>. Then surely such as lay them aside, as
reckoning them unsuitable for Christians, are not to be blamed,
but rather commended for so doing: Because that in Principle and
Practice they effectually advance that, which others acknowledge
were desirable, but can never make effectual, so long as they allow
the Use of them as lawful. And God hath made it manifest in this
Age, That by discovering the Evil of such Things, and leading his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a>[Pg 455]</span>
Witnesses out of them, and to testify against them, he hath produced
effectually in many that <i>Mortification</i> and <i>Abstraction</i> from the
<i>Love and Cares of this World</i>, who daily are conversing in the World
(but inwardly redeemed out of it) both in <i>Wedlock</i>, and in their
lawful Employments, which was judged could only be obtained by
such as were shut up in <i>Cloisters</i> and <i>Monasteries</i>. Thus much in
General.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. III.</h3> As to the first we affirm positively, That <i>it is not lawful for
Christians either to give or receive these Titles of Honour</i>, as, <i>Your Holiness</i>,
<i>Your Majesty</i>, <i>Your Excellency</i>, <i>Your Eminency</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Titles.</i></span><i>First</i>, Because these <i>Titles</i> are no Part of that Obedience which is
due to <i>Magistrates</i> or <i>Superiors</i>; neither doth the giving them add to
or diminish from that Subjection we owe to them, which consists <i>in
obeying their just and lawful Commands</i>, not in <i>Titles</i> and <i>Designations</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Under the Law and Gospel.</i></span><i>Secondly</i>, We find not that in the Scripture any such <i>Titles</i> are
used, either under the <i>Law</i> or the <i>Gospel</i>: But that in the speaking
to <i>Kings</i>, <i>Princes</i>, or <i>Nobles</i>, they used only a simple Compellation,
as <i>O King!</i> and that without any further Designation, save perhaps
the Name of the Person, as, <i>O King</i> Agrippa, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Lying Titles</i>.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, It lays a Necessity upon <i>Christians</i> most frequently to <i>lie</i>;
because the Persons obtaining these <i>Titles</i>, either by Election or hereditarily,
may frequently be found to have nothing really in them
deserving them, or answering to them: As some, to whom it is
said, <i>Your Excellency</i>, having nothing of <i>Excellency in them</i>; and he
who is called, <i>Your Grace</i>, appears to be an Enemy to <i>Grace</i>; and
he who is called, <i>Your Honour</i>, is known to be base and ignoble.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Patents do not oblige to a Lie.</i></span>I wonder what Law of Man, or what Patent ought to oblige me to
make a Lie, in calling <i>Good, Evil</i>; and <i>Evil, Good</i>? I wonder what
Law of Man can secure me, in so doing, from the just Judgment of
God, that will make me account for <i>every idle Word</i>? And to <i>lie</i> is
something more. Surely Christians should be ashamed that such
Laws, manifestly crossing the Law of God, should be among them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a>[Pg 456]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, <i>We ought in Charity to suppose that they have these Virtues,
because the King has bestowed those Titles upon them, or that they are descended
of such as deserved them</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, <i>Charity</i> destroys not <i>Knowledge</i>: I am not obliged by
<i>Charity</i>, either to believe or speak a <i>Lie</i>. Now it is apparent, and
cannot be denied by any, but that those Virtues are not in many of
the Persons expressed by the <i>Titles</i> they bear; neither will they allow
to speak so to such, in whom these Virtues are, unless they be
so dignified by outward Princes. So that such as are truly virtuous,
must not be stiled by their Virtues, because not privileged by
the Princes of this World; and such as have them not, must be so
called, because they have obtained a Patent so to be: And all this
is done by those, who pretend to be his Followers, that commanded
his Disciples, <i>Not to be called of Men, Master</i>; and told them, Such
could <i>not believe, as received Honour one from another, and sought not the
Honour which cometh from God only</i>. This is so plain, to such as will
indeed be <i>Christians</i>, that it needs no Consequence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Your Holiness</i>, <i>Your Grace</i>, &amp;c.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, As to those Titles of <i>Holiness</i>, <i>Eminency</i>, and <i>Excellency</i>,
used among the <i>Papists</i> to the <i>Pope</i> and <i>Cardinals</i>, &amp;c. and <i>Grace</i>, <i>Lordship</i>,
and <i>Worship</i>, used to the <i>Clergy</i> among the <i>Protestants</i>, it is a most
blasphemous Usurpation. For if they use <i>Holiness</i> and <i>Grace</i>, because
these Things ought to be in a <i>Pope</i>, or in a <i>Bishop</i>, how come
they to usurp that peculiarly to themselves? Ought not <i>Holiness</i>
and <i>Grace</i> to be in every Christian? And so every Christian should
say, <i>Your Holiness</i>, and <i>Your Grace</i>, one to another. Next, how
can they in Reason claim any more <i>Titles</i>, than were practised and
received by the Apostles and Primitive Christians, whose Successors
they pretend they are, and as whole Successors (and no otherwise)
themselves, I judge, will confess any Honour they seek is due to
them? Now if they neither sought, received, nor admitted such
<i>Honour</i> nor <i>Titles</i>, how came these by them? If they say they did,
let them prove it if they can: We find no such Thing in the
Scripture. The Christians speak to the Apostles without any such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a>[Pg 457]</span>
Denomination, neither saying, <i>If it please Your Grace</i>, <i>Your Holiness</i>,
<i>Your Lordship</i>, nor <i>Your Worship</i>; they are neither called, <i>My Lord</i>
Peter, nor <i>My Lord</i> Paul; nor yet <i>Master</i> Peter, nor <i>Master</i> Paul;
nor <i>Doctor</i> Peter, nor <i>Doctor</i> Paul; but singly <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i>; and
that not only in the Scripture, but for some hundreds of Years
after: So that this appears to be a manifest Fruit of the Apostasy.
For if these <i>Titles</i> arise either from the <i>Office</i> or <i>Worth</i> of the Persons,
it will not be denied but the Apostles deserved them better than
any now that call for them. But the Case is plain, The Apostles
had the <i>Holiness</i>, the <i>Excellency</i>, the <i>Grace</i>; and because they were
<i>holy</i>, <i>excellent</i>, and <i>gracious</i>, they neither used, nor admitted of such
<i>Titles</i>:<span class="sidenote"><i>Hypocrites want Titles.</i></span> But these having neither <i>Holiness</i>, <i>Excellency</i>, nor <i>Grace</i>, will
needs be so called, to satisfy their ambitious and ostentatious Minds,
which is a manifest Token of their <i>Hypocrisy</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, As to that Title of <i>Majesty</i>, usually ascribed to Princes,
we do not find it given to any such in the Holy Scripture; but
that it is specially and peculiarly ascribed unto God, as 1 <i>Chron.</i>
xxix. 11. <i>Job.</i> xxxvii. 22. <i>Psal.</i> xxi. 5. and xxix. 4. and xlv. 3. and
cxiii. 1. and xcvi. 6. <i>Isa.</i> ii. 10. and xxiv. 14. and xxvi. 10. <i>Heb.</i>
i. 3. 2 <i>Pet.</i> i. 16. and many more Places. Hence saith <i>Jude</i>, Ver. 25.
<i>To the only wise God our Saviour, be Glory and Majesty</i>, &amp;c. not to Men.
We find in Scripture the proud King <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> assuming this
<i>Title</i> to himself, <i>Dan.</i> iv. 30. who at that Time received a sufficient
Reproof, by a sudden Judgment which came upon him. Therefore
in all the Compellations used to Princes in the <i>Old Testament</i>, it is
not to be found, nor yet in the <i>New</i>. <i>Paul</i> was very civil to <i>Agrippa</i>,
yet he gives him no such <i>Title</i>: Neither was this <i>Title</i> used among
Christians in the primitive Times.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Eccles. Hist. L. 4. P. 445.</i></span>Hence the <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> of
the Reformation of <i>France</i>, relating the Speech of the Lord <i>Rochefort</i>,
at the Assembly of the Estates of <i>France</i>, held under <i>Charles</i> the
Ninth, in the Year 1560, saith,
<span class="sidenote">Your Majesty<i> not used; how taken Notice of in 1560.</i></span><i>That this Harangue was well remarked,
in that he used not the Word </i>[Majesty]<i> invented by Flatterers of late Years.</i>
And yet this Author minded not how his Master <i>Calvin</i> used this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a>[Pg 458]</span>
<i>flattering Title</i> to <i>Francis</i> the First, King of <i>France</i>; and not only so,
but calls him <i>Most Christian King</i>, in the Epistle to his <i>Institutions</i>;
though by his daily persecuting of the <i>Reformers</i>, it was apparent,
he was far from being such, even in <i>Calvin</i>’s own Esteem. Surely
the Complying with such vain <i>Titles</i>, imposed and introduced by
<i>Antichrist</i>, greatly tended to stain the <i>Reformation</i>, and to render it
defective in many Things.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, All these <i>Titles</i> and <i>Stiles</i> of <i>Honour</i> are to be rejected by
<i>Christians</i>, because they are to seek the <i>Honour that comes from above</i>,
and not the <i>Honour</i> that is from <i>below</i>: But these Honours are not
that Honour that comes from above, but are from below. For we
know well enough what Industry, and what Pains Men are at to
get these Things, and what Part it is that seeks after them, to wit,
the <i>proud, insolent, haughty, aspiring Mind</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The proud Mind loves Titles.</i></span>For judge, Is it the <i>meek</i>
and <i>innocent Spirit of Christ</i> that covets that Honour? Is it that Spirit
that must be of <i>no Reputation in this World</i>, that has its <a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a><i>Conversation in
Heaven</i>, that comes to have <i>Fellowship with the Sons of God</i>? Is it that
Spirit, I say, that loves that Honour, that seeks after that Honour,
that pleads for the Upholding of that Honour, that frets, and rages,
and fumes, when it is denied that Honour?
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lucifer’s Spirit.</i></span>Or is it not rather the
lordly insulting Spirit of <i>Lucifer</i>, the <i>Prince of this World</i>, he that of
old affected and sought after this Honour, and loved not to abide in
the submissive low Place? And so all his Children are possessed with
the same ambitious proud Mind, seeking and covering <i>Titles</i> of
<i>Honour</i>, which indeed belong not to them. For let us examine,
<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a><i>Who they are that are honourable indeed?</i> <a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>Is it not the <i>righteous Man</i>?
Is it not the <i>holy Man</i>? Is it not the <i>humble-hearted Man</i>, the <i>meek-spirited
Man</i>? And are not such those that ought to be <i>honoured</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a>[Pg 459]</span>
among <i>Christians</i>? Now of these, may there not be poor Men,
Labourers, silly Fishermen? And if so, how comes it that the <i>Titles</i>
of <i>Honour</i> are not bestowed upon such? But who are they that generally
receive and look for this Honour? Are they not the rich
Ones, such as have abundance of the Earth, as be like the rich
Glutton, such as are proud and ambitious, such as are Oppressors
of the Poor, such as swell with Lust and Vanity, and all <i>Superfluity
of Naughtiness</i>, who are the very Abomination and Plague of the
Nations? Are not these they that are accounted honourable, that
require and receive the Titles of Honour, proud <i>Hamans</i>? Now
whether is this the Honour that comes from God, or the Honour
from below? Doth God honour such as daily dishonour him, and
disobey him? And if this be not the Honour that comes from God,
but the Honour of this World, which the Children of this World
give and receive one from another; how can the Children of God,
such as are Christians indeed, give or receive that Honour among
themselves, without coming under the Reproof of Christ, who saith,
That <i>such as do cannot believe</i>? But further, If we respect the Cause
that most frequently procures to Men these <i>Titles</i> of <i>Honour</i>, there
is not one of a Thousand that shall be found to be because of any
Christian Virtue; but rather for Things to be discommended among
<i>Christians</i>: As by the Favour of <i>Princes</i>, procured by flattering, and
often by worse Means. Yea, the most frequent, and accounted
among Men most honourable, is <i>Fighting</i>, or some great <i>martial Exploit</i>,
which can add nothing to a Christian’s Worth: Since, sure it
is, it were desirable there were no <i>Fightings</i> among Christians at all;
and in so far as there are, it shews they are not right Christians.
And <i>James</i> tells us, That <i>Fighting proceeds from the Lusts</i>. So that it
were fitter for Christians, by the <i>Sword of God’s Spirit</i>, to fight against
their Lusts, than by the Prevalency of their Lusts to destroy one
another. Whatever Honour any might have attained of old under
the <i>Law</i> this Way, we find under the <i>Gospel</i> Christians commended
for <i>Suffering</i>, not for <i>Fighting</i>; neither did any of Christ’s Disciples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a>[Pg 460]</span>
save one, offer outward Violence by the Sword, in cutting off
<i>Malchus</i>’s Ear; for which he received no Title of Honour, but a
just Reproof. Finally, if we look either to the <i>Nature</i> of this <i>Honour</i>,
the <i>Cause</i> of it, the <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Ways"><i>Way</i></span> it is conveyed, the <i>Terms</i> in which it is delivered,
it cannot be used by such as desire to be <i>Christians</i> in good
Earnest.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. IV.</h3> Now besides these general <i>Titles</i> of <i>Honour</i>, what gross
Abuses are crept in among such as are called <i>Christians</i> in the Use of
<i>Compliments</i>, wherein not Servants to Masters, or others, with Respect
to any such Kind of Relations, but others, who have no such
Relation do say and write to one another at every Turn, <i>Your humble
Servant</i>, <i>Your most obedient Servant</i>, &amp;c. Such wicked Customs have,
to the great Prejudice of Souls, accustomed Christians to lie; and to
use Lying is now come to be accounted Civility. O horrid Apostasy!
for it is notoriously known, that the Use of these <i>Compliments</i>
imports not any Design of Service, neither are any such Fools to
think so; for if we should put them to it that say so, they would
no doubt think we abused them; and would soon let us know they
gave us Words in Course, and no more. It is strange, That such
as pretend to <i>Scripture</i> as <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: the">their</span> Rule should not be ashamed to use such
Things; since <i>Elihu</i>, who had not the Scriptures, could by the <i>Light
within him</i> (which these Men think insufficient) say, <i>Job.</i> xxxii. 21, 22.
<i>Let me not accept any Man’s Person, neither let me give flattering Titles unto
Men. For I know not to give flattering Titles; in so doing my Maker would
soon take me away.</i> A certain ancient devout Man, in the primitive
Time, subscribed himself to a Bishop, <i>Your humble Servant</i>; wherein
I doubt not but he was more real than our usual <i>Complimenters</i>; and
yet he was sharply reproved for it.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_157_157" id="Footnote_157_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157_157"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> This History is reported by <i>Casaubonus</i>, in his Book of <i>Manners</i> and <i>Customs</i>, P. 160. “In
this last Age he is esteemed an uncivil Man, who will not either to his Inferior or Equal subscribe
himself <i>Servant</i>. But <i>Sulpitius Severus</i> was heretofore sharply reproved by <i>Paulinus</i>, Bishop
of <i>Nola</i>, because in his Epistle he had subscribed himself his Servant, saying, <i>Beware thou subscribe
not thyself his </i>Servant<i>, who is </i>thy Brother<i>; for Flattery is sinful, not a Testimony of Humility to give
these Honours to Men, which are only due to the One Lord, Master, and GOD</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a>[Pg 461]</span></p></div>

<p>But they usually object, to defend themselves, <i>That </i>Luke<i> saith,
Most Excellent </i>Theophilus; <i>and </i>Paul,<i> Most Noble </i>Festus.</p>

<p>I <i>answer</i>, Since <i>Luke</i> wrote that by the Dictates of the <i>Infallible
Spirit of God</i>, I think it will not be doubted but <i>Theophilus</i> did deserve
it, as being really endued with that Virtue: In which Case
we shall not condemn those that do it by the same Rule. But it is
not proved that <i>Luke</i> gave <i>Theophilus</i> this Title, as that which was
derived to him, either from his Father, or by any Patent <i>Theophilus</i> had
obtained from any of the Princes of the Earth? or that he would
have given it him, in Case he had not been truly <i>excellent</i>: And
unless this be proved (which never can) there can nothing hence
be deduced against us.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Concerning the Title </i>Paul<i> gave to </i>Festus.</span>The like may be said of that of <i>Paul</i> to
<i>Festus</i>, whom he would not have called such, if he had not been
truly <i>noble</i>; as indeed he was, in that he suffered him to be heard
in his own Cause, and would not give Way to the Fury of the
<i>Jews</i> against him; it was not because of any outward Title bestowed
upon <i>Festus</i>, that he so called him, else he would have given the
same Appellation to his Predecessor <i>Felix</i>, who had the same Office;
but being a covetous Man, we find he gives him no such
<i>Stile</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. V.</h3>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The </i>Singular Number<i> to one Person used in the </i>Latin.</span>It will not be unfit in this Place to say something concerning
the Using of the <i>Singular Number</i> to one Person; of this there is
no Controversy in the <i>Latin</i>. For when we speak to one, we always
use the <i>Pronoun</i> [TU,] and he that would do otherwise, would
break the Rules of <i>Grammar</i>. For what Boy, learning his Rudiments,
is ignorant, that it is incongruous to say [<i>vos amas</i>, <i>vos legis</i>,]
that is [<i>you lovest</i>, <i>you readest</i>] speaking to one? But the Pride of
Man, that hath corrupted many Things, refuses also to use this
<i>Simplicity</i> of speaking in the vulgar Languages. For being puffed
up with a vain Opinion of themselves, as if the <i>Singular Number</i> were
not sufficient for them, they will have others to speak to them in
the <i>Plural</i>. Hence <i>Luther</i>, in his <i>Plays</i>, reproves and mocks this
Manner of speaking, saying, <i>Magister, vos es iratus</i>: Which Corrup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a>[Pg 462]</span>tion
<i>Erasmus</i> sufficiently refutes in his Book of <i>Writing Epistles</i>: Concerning
which likewise <i>James Howel</i>, in his Epistle to the <i>Nobility</i> of
<i>England</i>, before the <i>French</i> and <i>English Dictionary</i>, takes Notice,
“That both in <i>France</i>, and in other Nations, the Word [THOU]
was used in speaking to one; but by Succession of Time,
<span class="sidenote"><i>How the Word </i>You<i> came to be used to a single Person.</i></span>when
the <i>Roman</i> Commonwealth grew into an Empire, the Courtiers
began to magnify the Emperor, (as being furnished with Power
to confer Dignities and Offices) using the Word [<i>You</i>,] yea, and
deifying him with more remarkable Titles;” Concerning which
Matter, we read in the Epistles of <i>Symmachus</i> to the Emperors <i>Theodosius</i>
and <i>Valentinianus</i>, where he useth these Forms of Speaking,
“<i>Vestra Æternitas</i>, Your Eternity; <i>Vestrum Numen</i>, Your Godhead;
<i>Vestra Serenitas</i>, Your Serenity; <i>Vestra Clementia</i>, Your Clemency.
So that the Word [<i>You</i>] in the Plural Number, together with the
other Titles and Compellations of Honour, seem to have taken
their Rise from <i>Monarchical Government</i>; which afterwards, by Degrees,
came to be derived to private Persons.”</div>

<p>The same is witnessed by <i>John Maresius</i>, of the <i>French Academy</i>;
in the Preface of his <i>Clovis</i>: “Let none wonder (saith he) that the
Word [<i>Thou</i>] is used in this Work to <i>Princes</i> and <i>Princesses</i>; for we
use the same to God: And of old the same was used to <i>Alexanders</i>,
<i>Cæsars</i>, <i>Queens</i> and <i>Empresses</i>. The Use of the Word [<i>You</i>,] when
one Person is spoken to, was only introduced by these base Flatteries
of Men of latter Ages, to whom it seemed good to use the
Plural Number to one Person, that he may imagine himself alone
to be equal to many others in Dignity and Worth; from whence
at last it came to Persons of lower Quality.”</p>

<p>To the same Purpose speaketh also <i>M. Godeau</i>, in his Preface to
the <i>New Testament Translation</i>: “I had rather (saith he) faithfully
keep to the express Words of <i>Paul</i>, than exactly follow the polished
Stile of our Tongue; therefore I always use that Form of
calling God in the <i>Singular Number</i>, not in the <i>Plural</i>; and therefore
I say rather [<i>Thou</i>] than [<i>You</i>.] I confess indeed, That the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a>[Pg 463]</span>
Civility and Custom of this World requires him to be honoured
after that Manner; but it is likewise on the contrary true, that
the original Tongue of the New Testament hath nothing common
with such Manners and Civility; so that not one of these many
old Versions we have doth observe it. Let not Men believe, That
we give not Respect enough to God, in that we call him by the
Word [<i>Thou</i>] which is nevertheless far otherwise;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Word </i>Thou<i>, a greater Honour to One than </i>You.</span>for I seem to
myself (may be by the Effect of Custom) more to honour his Divine
Majesty, in calling him after this Manner, than if I should
call him after the Manner of Men, who are so delicate in their
Forms of Speech.”</p>

<p>See how clearly and evidently these Men witness, That this Form
of Speaking, and these profane Titles, derive their Origin from the
base Flattery of these last Ages, and from the delicate Haughtiness
of <i>worldly Men</i>, who have invented these <i>Novelties</i>, that thereby they
might honour one another, under I know not what Pretence of <i>Civility</i>
and <i>Respect</i>. From whence many of the present <i>Christians</i> (so
accounted) are become so perverse, in commending most wicked
Men, and wicked Customs, that the <i>Simplicity</i> of the <i>Gospel</i> is wholly
lost; so that the giving of Men and Things their own Names is not
only worn out of Custom, but the doing thereof is accounted absurd
and rude by such Kind of <i>delicate Parasites</i>, who desire to ascribe
to this Flattery, and abuse the Name of <i>Civility</i>. Moreover, that this
Way of speaking proceeds from an high and proud Mind, hence
appears, because that Men commonly use the <i>Singular Number</i> to
<i>Beggars</i>, and to their <i>Servants</i>; yea, and in their <i>Prayers to God</i>. Thus
the <i>Superior</i> will speak to his <i>Inferior</i>, who yet will not bear that the
<i>Inferior</i> so speak to him, as judging it a Kind of Reproach unto him.
So hath the Pride of Men placed <i>God</i> and the <i>Beggar</i> in the same <i>Category</i>.
I think I need not use Arguments to prove to such as know
congruous Language, That we ought to use the <i>Singular Number</i> speaking
to one; which is the common Dialect of the whole Scripture,
as also the most Interpreters do translate it. Seeing therefore it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a>[Pg 464]</span>
manifest to us, that this Form of speaking to Men in the <i>Plural Number</i>
doth proceed from <i>Pride</i>, as well as that it is in itself a <i>Lie</i>, we
found a Necessity upon us to testify against this Corruption, by
using the <i>Singular</i> equally unto <i>all</i>. And although no Reason can
be given why we should be persecuted upon this Account, especially
by <i>Christians</i>, who profess to follow the Rule of Scripture, whose
Dialect this is;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Scripture Dialect the plain Language</i>.</span>yet it would perhaps seem incredible if I should relate
how much we have suffered for this Thing, and how these
proud Ones have <i>fumed</i>, <i>fretted</i>, and <i>gnashed</i> their <i>Teeth</i>, frequently
<i>beating</i> and <i>striking</i> us, when we have spoken to them thus in the
<i>Singular Number</i>: Whereby we are the more confirmed in our Judgment,
as seeing that this <i>Testimony of Truth</i>, which God hath given
us to bear in all Things, doth so vex the serpentine Nature in the
<i>Children of Darkness</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Bowing to Men</i>, &amp;c.</span><i>Secondly</i>, Next unto this of <i>Titles</i>, the other Part of <i>Honour</i>
used among <i>Christians</i> is the <i>Kneeling</i>, <i>Bowing</i>, and <i>Uncovering of the
Head</i> to one another. I know nothing our Adversaries have to
plead for them in this Matter, save some few Instances of the <i>Old
Testament</i>, and the <i>Custom</i> of the Country.</div>

<p>The first are, Such as <i><span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Abram’s">Abraham’s</span> bowing himself to the Children of </i>Heth<i>,
and </i>Lot<i> to the two Angels</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But the Practice of these <i>Patriarchs</i>, related as Matter of Fact, is
not to be a Rule to <i>Christians</i> now; neither are we to imitate them
in every Practice, which has not a particular Reproof added to it:
For we find not <i>Abraham</i> reproved for taking <i>Hagar</i>, &amp;c. And indeed
to say all Things were lawful for us which they practised, would
produce great Inconveniences obvious enough to all.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Custom of the Nations no Rule to Christians.</i></span>And as to the
<i>Customs of the Nations</i>, it is a very ill Argument for a Christian’s Practice:
We should have a better Rule to walk by than the <i>Custom</i> of
the <i>Gentiles</i>; the Apostles desire us not to be <a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a><i>conformed to this World</i>,
&amp;c. We see how little they have to say for themselves in this Matter.
Let it be observed then, Whether our Reasons for laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a>[Pg 465]</span>
aside these Things be not considerable and weighty enough to uphold
us in so doing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_158_158" id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> Rom. 12. 2.</p></div>

<p><i>First</i>, We say, <i>That God, who is the Creator of Man, and he to whom
he oweth the Dedication both of Soul and Body, is over all to be worshipped
and adored, and that not only by the Spirit, but also with the Prostration of
Body</i>. Now, <i>Kneeling</i>, <i>Bowing</i>, and <i>Uncovering of the Head</i>, is the alone
outward Signification of our <i>Adoration</i> towards <i>God</i>, <i>and therefore it
is not lawful to give it unto Man</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Bowing is adoring, and is only due to God.</i></span>He that kneeleth, or prostrates himself
to Man, what doth he more to God? He that boweth, and
uncovereth his Head to the <i>Creature</i>, what hath he reserved to the
<i>Creator</i>? Now the Apostle shews us, That the <i>Uncovering of the
Head</i> is that which God requires of us in our worshipping of him,
1 <i>Cor.</i> xi. 14. But if we make our Address to Men in the same Manner,
where lieth the Difference? Not in the outward <i>Signification</i>,
but merely in the <i>Intention</i>; which opens a Door for the <i>Popish Veneration</i>
of <i>Images</i>, which hereby is necessarily excluded.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>Men being alike by Creation</i> (though their being stated
under their several Relations requires from them mutual Services according
to those respective Relations) <i>owe not Worship one to another,
but all equally are to return it to God: Because it is to him, and his Name
alone, that every Knee must bow, and before whose Throne the four-and-twenty
Elders prostrate themselves</i>. Therefore for Men to take this
one from another, is to rob God of his Glory: Since all the Duties
of Relations may be performed one to another without these
Kind of Bowings, which therefore are no essential Part of our Duty
to Man, but to God. All Men, by an inward instinct, in all
Nations have been led to prostrate and bow themselves to God.
And it is plain that this Bowing to Men took Place from a <i>slavish
Fear</i> possessing some, which led them to set up others as Gods;
when also an ambitious proud Spirit got up in those others, to
usurp the Place of God over their Brethren.</p>

<p>Thirdly, <i>We see that </i>Peter<i> refused it from </i>Cornelius<i>, saying, He was
a Man</i>. Are then the <i>Popes</i> more, or more excellent than <i>Peter</i>, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a>[Pg 466]</span>
suffer Men daily to fall down at their Feet, and kiss them?
<span class="sidenote">Peter<i> and the </i>Angel<i> refused Bowing.</i></span>This Reproof
of <i>Peter</i> to <i>Cornelius</i> doth abundantly shew, that such Manners
were not to be admitted among Christians. Yea, we see, that the
<i>Angel</i> twice refused this Kind of <i>Bowing</i> from <i>John</i>, Rev. xix. 10. and
xxii. 9. for this Reason, <i>Because I am thy Fellow-servant, and of thy
Brethren</i>; abundantly intimating that it is <i>not lawful for Fellow-servants</i>
thus to prostrate themselves one to another: And in this Respect all
Men are <i>Fellow-servants</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span>If it be said, John <i>intended here a Religious Worship, and not a
Civil</i>;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, This is to say, not to prove: Neither can we suppose
<i>John</i>, at that Time of the Day, so ill-instructed as not to know it
was unlawful to worship <i>Angels</i>; only it should seem, because of
those great and mysterious Things revealed to him by that <i>Angel</i>,
he was willing to signify some more than ordinary Testimony of
Respect, for which he was reproved. These Things being thus considered,
it is remitted to the Judgment of such as are desirous to be
found <i>Christians</i> indeed, whether we are worthy of Blame for waving
it to Men. Let those then that will blame us consider whether they
might not as well accuse <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Mordicai"><i>Mordecai</i></span> of Incivility, who was no less
singular than we in this Matter. <span class="sidenote"><i>To forbear</i>
Bowing <i>to Men is no Incivility, nor Pride, nor Rudeness</i>.</span>And forasmuch as they accuse us
herein of <i>Rudeness</i> and <i>Pride</i>, though the Testimony of our Consciences
in the Sight of God be a sufficient Guard against such Calumnies,
yet there are of us known to be Men of such Education, as
forbear not these Things for want of that they call <i>good Breeding</i>;
and we should be very void of Reason, to purchase that <i>Pride</i> at so
dear a Rate, as many have done the Exercise of their Conscience
in this Matter; many of us having been <i>sorely beaten</i> and <i>buffeted</i>,
yea, and several Months <i>imprisoned</i>, for no other Reason but because
we could not so satisfy the <i>proud unreasonable Humours of proud Men</i>,
as to <i>uncover our Heads</i>, and <i>bow our Bodies</i>. Nor doth our innocent
Practice, in standing still, though upright, not putting off our <i>Hats</i>,
any more than our <i>Shoes</i>, the one being the Covering of our <i>Heads</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a>[Pg 467]</span>
as well as the other of our <i>Feet</i>, shew so much Rudeness, as their beating
and knocking us, <i>&amp;c.</i> because we cannot <i>Bow</i> to them, contrary
to our Consciences: Which certainly shews less <i>Meekness</i> and
<i>Humility</i> upon their Part, than it doth of <i>Rudeness</i> or <i>Pride</i> upon
ours. Now suppose it were our Weakness, and we really under a
Mistake in this Thing, since it is not alleged to be the Breach of
any <i>Christian Precept</i>, are we not to be indulged, as the Apostle commanded
should be done to such as scrupled to <i>eat Flesh</i>? And <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: do">doth</span>
not persecuting and reviling us upon this Account shew them to
be more like unto proud <i>Haman</i>, than the Disciples or Followers of
the <i>meek, self-denying Jesus</i>? And this I can say boldly, in the Sight
of God, from my own Experience, and that of many Thousands
more, that however small or foolish this may seem, yet we behoved
to choose Death rather than do it, and that for Conscience Sake:
And that in its being so contrary to our natural Spirits, there are
many of us, to whom the Forsaking of these Bowings and Ceremonies
was as Death itself; which we could never have left, if we
could have enjoyed our Peace with God in the Use of them. <i>Though
it be far from us to judge all those to whom God hath not shewn the Evil of
them, under the like Hazard</i>; yet nevertheless we doubt not but to
such as would prove <i>faithful Witnesses</i> to <i>Christ’s Divine Light</i> in their
<i>Consciences</i>, God will also shew the Evil of these Things.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Apparel<i> in its Vanity and Superfluity disallowed.</i></span>The <i>Third</i> Thing to be treated of, is the <i>Vanity and Superfluity
of Apparel</i>. In which, <i>First</i>, Two Things are to be considered,
the <i>Condition of the Person</i>, and the <i>Country he lives in</i>. We shall not
say that all Persons are to be clothed alike, because it will perhaps
neither suit their Bodies nor their Estates. And if a Man be clothed
<i>soberly</i>, and without <i>Superfluity</i>, though they may be <i>finer</i> than that
which his Servant is clothed with, we shall not blame him for it:
The abstaining from <i>Superfluities</i>, which his Condition and Education
have accustomed him to, may be in him a greater Act of Mortification
than the abstaining from <i>finer Clothes</i> in the Servant, who
never was accustomed to them. As to the <i>Country</i>, what it natu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a>[Pg 468]</span>rally
produces may be no Vanity to the Inhabitants to use, or what
is commonly imparted to them by Way of Exchange, seeing it is
without Doubt that the Creation is for the Use of Man. So where
<i>Silk</i> abounds, it may be worn as well as <i>Wool</i>; and were we in those
Countries, or near unto them, where <i>Gold</i> or <i>Silver</i> were as common
as <i>Iron</i> or <i>Brass</i>, the one might be used as well as the other. The
Iniquity lies then here, <i>First</i>, When from a Lust of Vanity, and a
Desire to adorn themselves, Men and Women, not content with
what their Condition can bear, or their Country easily affords, do
stretch to have Things, that from their Rarity, and the Price that is
put upon them, seem to be precious, and so feed their Lust the
more; and this all sober Men of all Sorts will readily grant to
be Evil.</div>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, When Men are not content to make a true Use of the
Creation, whether the Things be <i>fine</i> or <i>coarse</i>, and do not satisfy
themselves with what Need and Conveniency call for, but add thereunto
Things merely <i>superfluous</i>, such as is the Use of <i>Ribbands</i> and <i>Lace</i>,
and much more of that Kind of Stuff, as <i>painting the Face, and plaiting
the Hair</i>, which are the Fruits of the <i>fallen</i>, <i>lustful</i>, and <i>corrupt Nature</i>,
and not of the <i>New Creation</i>, as all will acknowledge. And though
<i>sober Men</i> among all Sorts will say, That it were better these Things
were not, yet will they not reckon them unlawful, and therefore do
admit the Use of them among their Church-members: But we do
account them altogether unlawful, and unsuitable to <i>Christians</i>, and
that for these Reasons:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The proper Use of Clothes.</i></span>First, <i>The Use of Clothes came originally from the Fall</i>. If Man had
not fallen, it appears he would not have needed them; but this
miserable State made them necessary in two Respects: 1. <i>To cover his
Nakedness</i>; 2. <i>To keep him from the Cold</i>; which are both the proper and
principal Use of them. Now for Man to delight himself in that which
is the Fruit of his Iniquity, and the Consequence of his Sin, can be
no Ways lawful for him: So to extend Things beyond their real Use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a>[Pg 469]</span>
or to superadd Things wholly superfluous, is a manifest Abuse of
the <i>Creation</i>, and therefore not lawful to Christians.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Those that will needs so adorn themselves in the Use of
their Clothes, as to beset them with Things having no real Use or
Necessity, but merely for Ornament Sake, do openly declare,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Not to please their Lusts</i>.</span>That
the End of it is either to please their <i>Lust</i> (for which End these Things
are chiefly invented and contrived) or otherwise to gratify a <i>vain,
proud, and ostentatious Mind</i>; and it is obvious these are their general
Ends in so doing. Yea, we see how easily Men are puffed up with
their Garments, and how proud and vain they are, when adorned to
their Mind. Now how far these Things are below a true <i>Christian</i>, and
how unsuitable, needs very little Proof. Hereby those who love to
be <i>gaudy</i> and <i>superfluous</i> in their Clothes, shew they concern themselves
little with <i>Mortification</i> and <i>Self-denial</i>, and that they study to
beautify their Bodies more than their Souls; which proves they
think little upon <i>Mortality</i>, and so certainly are more <i>nominal</i> than
<i>real</i> Christians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Contrary to Scripture.</i></span><i>Thirdly</i>, The Scripture <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: severally">severely</span> reproves such Practices, both commending
and commanding the contrary; as <i>Isa.</i> iii. how severely
doth the Prophet reprove the Daughters of <i>Israel</i> for their <i>tinkling
Ornaments</i>, their <i>Cauls</i>, and their <i>round Tires</i>, their <i>Chains</i> and <i>Bracelets</i>,
&amp;c. and yet is it not strange to see Christians allow themselves in
these Things, from whom a more strict and exemplary Conversation
is required? Christ desires us not to be <i>anxious</i> about our Clothing,
<i>Matt.</i> vi. 25. and to shew the Vanity of such as glory in the Splendor
of their Clothing, tells them, <i>That even </i>Solomon<i>, in all his Glory,
was not to be compared to the Lily of the Field, which To-day is, and To-morrow
is cast into the Oven</i>. But surely they make small Reckoning
of Christ’s Words and Doctrine that are so curious in their Clothing,
and so industrious to deck themselves, and so earnest to justify it, and
so enraged when they are reproved for it. The Apostle <i>Paul</i> is very
positive in this Respect, 1 <i>Tim.</i> ii. 9, 10. <i>I will therefore in like Manner
also that Women adorn themselves in modest Apparel, with Shamefacedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a>[Pg 470]</span>
and Sobriety, and not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or costly
Array, but (which becometh Women professing Godliness) with good Works</i>.
To the same Purpose saith <i>Peter</i>, 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4. <i>Whose Adorning let it
not be that outward Adorning of plaiting the Hair, and wearing of Gold, or
of putting on of Apparel; but </i>let it be<i> the hidden Man of the Heart, in that
which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit</i>, &amp;c.
Here both the Apostles do very positively and expresly assert two
Things. <i>First</i>, That the <i>Adorning of Christian Women</i> (of whom it is
particularly spoken, I judge, because this Sex is most naturally inclined
to that Vanity, and that it seems that <i>Christian Men</i> in those
Days deserved not in this Respect so much to be reproved) ought
not to be outward, nor consist in the Apparel.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Plaiting the Hair</i>, &amp;c.</span><i>Secondly</i>, That they
ought not to use the <i>Plaiting of the Hair</i>, or <i>Ornaments</i>, &amp;c. which was
at that Time the Custom of the Nations. But is it not strange, That
such as make the Scripture their Rule, and pretend they are guided
by it, should not only be so generally in the Use of these Things,
which the Scripture so plainly condemns, but also should attempt
to justify themselves in so doing? For the Apostles not only commend
the Forbearance of these Things, as an Attainment commendable
in Christians, but condemn the Use of them as unlawful; and
yet may it not seem more strange, That in Contradiction to the
Apostle’s Doctrine, as if they had resolved to slight their Testimony,
they should condemn those that out of Conscience apply themselves
seriously to follow it, as if in so doing they were <i>singular</i>, <i>proud</i>, or
<i>superstitious</i>? This certainly betokens a sad <i>Apostasy</i> in those that will
be accounted Christians, that they are so offended with those who
love to follow Christ and his Apostles, in denying of, and departing
from, the lying Vanities of this perishing World; and so doth
much evidence their Affinity with those who <i>hate to be reproved</i>, and
<i>neither will enter themselves, nor suffer those that would</i>.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. VIII.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Sports,<i> &amp;c. inconsistent with the Gospel.</i></span><i>Fourthly</i>, Let us consider the Use of <i>Games</i>, <i>Sports</i>, <i>Comedies</i>,
and other such Things, commonly and indifferently used by all the
several Sorts of Christians, under the Notion of <i>Divertisement</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a>[Pg 471]</span>
<i>Recreation</i>, and see whether these Things can consist with the <i>Seriousness</i>,
<i>Gravity</i>, and <i>Godly Fear</i>, which the Gospel calls for. Let us
but view and look over the Notions of them that call themselves
Christians, whether <i>Papists</i> or <i>Protestants</i>, and see if generally there
be any Difference, save in mere Name and Profession, from the <i>Heathen</i>?
Doth not the same <i>Folly</i>, the same <i>Vanity</i>, the same <i>Abuse</i> of
<i>precious</i> and <i>irrevocable Time</i> abound? The same <i>Gaming</i>, <i>Sporting</i>,
<i>Playing</i>, and from thence <i>Quarrelling</i>, <i>Fighting</i>, <i>Swearing</i>, <i>Ranting</i>,
<i>Revelling</i>? Now how can these Things be remedied, so long as the
<i>Preachers</i> and <i>Professors</i>, and those who are the <i>Leaders</i> of the People,
do allow these Things, and account them not inconsistent with the
Profession of Christianity? And it is strange to see that these Things
are tolerated every where; the Inquisition lays no Hold on them,
neither at <i>Rome</i>, nor in <i>Spain</i>, where in their <i>Masquerades</i> all Manner
of <i>Obscenity</i>, <i>Folly</i>, yea, and <i>Atheism</i> is generally practised in the
Face of the World, to the great Scandal of the <i>Christian Name</i>: But
if any Man reprove them in these Things, and forsake their Superstitions,
and come seriously to <i>serve God</i>, and <i>worship him in the Spirit</i>,
he becomes their Prey, and is immediately exposed to cruel Sufferings.
Doth this bear any Relation to Christianity? Do these Things
look any Thing like the Churches of the Primitive Christians? Surely
not at all. I shall first cite some few <i>Scripture Testimonies</i>, being very
positive Precepts to Christians, and then see whether such as obey
them can admit of these forementioned Things. The Apostle commands
us, That <i>whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we do it all
to the Glory of God</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>By Sports and Games God is not glorified.</i></span>But I judge none will be so impudent as to affirm,
That in the Use of these <i>Sports</i> and <i>Games</i> God is glorified: If
any should so say, They would declare they neither knew God nor his
Glory. And Experience abundantly proves, That in the Practice
of these Things Men mind nothing less than the <i>Glory of God</i>, and
nothing more than the Satisfaction of their own <i>carnal Lusts</i>, <i>Wills</i>,
and <i>Appetites</i>. The Apostle desires us, 1 <i>Cor.</i> vii. 29. 31. <i>Because the
Time is short, that they that buy should be as though they possessed not; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a>[Pg 472]</span>
they that use this World, as not abusing it</i>, &amp;c. But how can they be
found in the Obedience of this Precept that plead for the Use of
these <i>Games</i> and <i>Sports</i>, who, it seems, think the Time so long, that
they cannot find Occasion enough to <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: enjoy">employ</span> it, neither in taking
Care for their Souls, nor yet in the necessary Care for their Bodies;
but invent these <i>Games</i> and <i>Sports</i> to pass it away, as if they wanted
other Work to serve God in, or be useful to the Creation? The
Apostle <i>Peter</i> desires us, <i>To pass the Time of our Sojourning here in Fear</i>,
1 Pet. i. 17. But will any say, That such as use <i>Dancing</i> and <i>Comedies</i>,
<i>Carding</i> and <i>Dicing</i>, do so much as mind this Precept in the Use
of these Things? Where there is nothing to be seen but <i>Lightness</i> and
<i>Vanity</i>, <i>Wantonness</i> and <i>Obscenity</i>, contrived to draw Men from the
<i>Fear</i> of God, and therefore no Doubt calculated for the Service of
the Devil. There is no Duty more frequently commanded, nor
more incumbent upon Christians, than the <i>Fear of the Lord</i>, to <i>stand
in Awe before him</i>, to <i>walk as in his Presence</i>; but if such as use these
Games and Sports will speak from their Consciences, they can, I
doubt not, experimentally declare, That this <i>Fear</i> is forgotten in
their Gaming: And if God by his <i>Light</i> secretly touch them, or
mind them of the <i>Vanity</i> of their Way, they strive to shut it out, and
use their Gaming as an Engine to put away from them that troublesome
Guest; and thus <i>make merry over the Just One, whom they have
slain and crucified in themselves</i>. But further, if Christ’s Reasoning be
to be heeded, who saith, <i>Matt.</i> xii. 35, 36. That <i>the good Man, out of
the good Treasure of the Heart, bringeth forth good Things; and an evil
Man, out of the evil Treasure, bringeth forth evil Things</i>, and that <i>of every
idle Word we shall give an Account in the Day of Judgment</i>, it may be
easily gathered from what <i>Treasure</i> these Inventions come; and it
may be easily proved, that it is from the <i>Evil</i>, and not the <i>Good</i>.
<span class="sidenote">Comedies<i> a studied Complex of idle lying Words.</i></span>How many <i>idle Words</i> do they necessarily produce? Yea, what are
<i>Comedies</i> but a <i>studied Complex of idle and lying Words</i>? Let Men that
believe their <i>Souls</i> are <i>immortal</i>, and that there will be a <i>Day of Judgment</i>,
in which these Words of Christ will be accomplished, answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a>[Pg 473]</span>
me, how all these will make Account in that <i>great</i> and <i>terrible Day</i>,
of all these <i>idle Words</i> that are necessarily made use of about <i>Dancing</i>,
<i>Gaming</i>, <i>Carding</i>, and <i>Comedies acting</i>? And yet how is it that by
Christians not condemning these Things, but allowing of them,
many that are accounted <i>Christians</i> take up their whole Time in
them, yea, make it their Trade and Employment? Such as the
<i>Dancing-masters</i> and <i>Comedians</i>, &amp;c. whose Hellish Conversations do
sufficiently declare what Master they serve, and to what End these
Things contribute. And it cannot be denied, as being obviously
manifest by Experience, That such as are Masters of these Occupations,
and are most delighted in them, if they be not open <i>Atheists</i>
and <i>Profligates</i>, are such at best as make Religion or the Care of their
Souls their least Business. Now if these Things were discountenanced
by <i>Christians</i>, as inconsistent with their Profession, it would
remove these Things; for these Wretches would be necessitated then
to betake themselves to some honest Livelihood, if they were not fed
and upholden by these. And as hereby a great Scandal and Stumbling-block
would be removed from off the <i>Christian Name</i>, so also
would that in Part be taken out of the Way which provokes the
Lord to with-hold his <i>Blessing</i>, and by Occasion of which Things
the Minds of many remain chained in <i>Darkness</i>, and drowned in
<i>Lust</i>, <i>Sensuality</i>, and <i>worldly Pleasures</i>, without any Sense of God’s
Fear, or their own Soul’s Salvation. Many of those called <i>Fathers
of the Church</i>, and other serious Persons, have signified their Regret
for these Things, and their Desires they might be remedied; of
whom many Citations might be alleged, which for Brevity’s Sake
I have omitted.</div>

<span class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i></span>But they object, <i>That Men’s Spirits could not subsist, if they were

Need of some Divertisement to recreate the Mind a little, whereby it being refreshed,

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; Though all this were granted, it would no Ways militate
against us, neither plead the Use of these Things, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a>[Pg 474]</span>
would have wholly laid aside. For that Men should be always in
the same Intentiveness of Mind, we do not plead, knowing how
impossible it is, so long as we are clothed with this Tabernacle of
Clay. But this will not allow us at any <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Time to">Time so to</span> recede from the
Remembrance of God, and of our Souls chief Concern, as not still
to retain a certain Sense of his <i>Fear</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Fear of God the best Recreation in the World.</i></span>which cannot be so much as

Now the necessary Occasions in which all are involved, in

of the Mind from the more serious Duties; and those are
performed in the Blessing, as the Mind is so leavened with the Love
of God, and the Sense of his Presence, that even in doing these
Things the Soul carrieth with it that <i>Divine Influence</i> and <i>Spiritual
Habit</i>, whereby though these Acts, as of <i>eating</i>, <i>drinking</i>, <i>sleeping</i>,
<i>working</i>, be upon the Matter one with what the Wicked do, yet they
are done in another Spirit; and in doing of them we please the
Lord, serve him, and answer our End in the Creation, and so feel
and are sensible of his <i>Blessing</i>: Whereas the Wicked and Profane,
being not come to this Place, are in whatsoever they do <i>cursed</i>, and
their <i>Ploughing</i> as well as <i>Praying</i> is <i>Sin</i>. Now if any will plead, that
for Relaxation of Mind, there may be a Liberty allowed beyond
these Things, which are of absolute Need to the Sustenance of the
outward Man, I shall not much contend against it; provided these
Things be not such as are wholly superfluous, or in their proper Nature
and Tendency lead the Mind into <i>Lust</i>, <i>Vanity</i>, and <i>Wantonness</i>, as
being chiefly contrived and framed for that End, or generally experienced
to produce these Effects, or being the common Engines of
such as are so minded to feed one another therein, and to propagate
their Wickedness, to the imprisoning of others; seeing there are
other innocent Divertisements which may sufficiently serve for Relaxation
of the Mind,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Lawful Divertisements.</i></span>such as for <i>Friends to visit one another</i>; <i>to hear or
read History</i>; <i>to speak soberly of the present or past Transactions</i>; <i>to follow
after Gardening</i>; <i>to use Geometrical and Mathematical Experiments</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a>[Pg 475]</span>
such other Things of this Nature. In all which Things we are not
to forget God, <i>in whom we both live, and are moved</i>, Acts xvii. 28. as
not to have always some <i>secret Reserve</i> to him, and Sense of his Fear
and Presence; which also frequently exerts itself in the Midst of
these Things by some short Aspiration and Breathings. And that
this may neither seem <i>strange</i> nor <i>troublesome</i>, I shall clear it by one
manifest Instance, answerable to the Experience of all Men. It will
not be denied but that Men ought to be more in the Love of God
than of any other Thing; for we ought to <i>love God above all Things</i>.
Now it is plain, that Men that are taken with Love, whether it be
of Women, or of any other Thing, if it hath taken a deep Place in
the Heart, and possess the Mind, it will be hard for the Man so in
Love to drive out of his Mind the Person or Thing so loved; yea,
in his eating, drinking, and sleeping, his Mind will always have a
Tendency that Way; and in Business or Recreations, however intent
he be in it, there will but a very short Time be permitted to
pass, but the Mind will let some Ejaculation forth towards its Beloved.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Love towards its Beloved shuns its Offence.</i></span>And albeit such a One must be conversant in those Things
that the Care of this Body and such like Things call for; yet will
he avoid as Death itself to do those Things that may offend the Party
so beloved, or cross his Design in obtaining the Thing so earnestly
desired: Though there may be some small Use in them, the great
Design, which is chiefly in his Eye, will so balance him, that he will
easily look over and dispense with such petty Necessities, rather than
endanger the Loss of the Greater by them. Now that Men ought
to be thus <i>in Love with God</i>, and the <i>Life to come</i>, none will deny;
and the Thing is apparent from these Scriptures, <i>Mat.</i> vi. 20. <i>But
lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven.</i> Col. iii. 2. <i>Set your Affection
on Things above</i>, &amp;c. And that this hath been the Experience and
Attainment of some, the Scripture also declares, <i>Psalm</i> lxiii. 1. 8.
2 <i>Cor.</i> v. 4.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Sports and Plays draw Men from the Fear of God.</i></span>And again, That these <i>Games</i>, <i>Sports</i>, <i>Plays</i>, <i>Dancing</i>, <i>Comedies</i>, &amp;c.
do naturally tend to draw Men from <i>God’s Fear</i>, to make them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a>[Pg 476]</span>get
<i>Heaven</i>, <i>Death</i>, and <i>Judgment</i>, to foster <i>Lust</i>, <i>Vanity</i>, and <i>Wantonness</i>,
and therefore are most <i>loved</i>, as well as <i>used</i>, by such Kind of
Persons, Experience abundantly shews, and the most serious and conscientious
among all will scarcely deny; which if it be so, the Application
is easy.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. X.</h3> <i>Fifthly</i>, The Use of <i>Swearing</i> is to be considered, which is so
frequently practised almost among all Christians; not only <i>profane
Oaths</i> among the <i>Profane</i>, in their common Discourses, whereby the
<i>Most HOLY NAME of GOD</i> is in a horrible Manner daily blasphemed;
but also <i>solemn Oaths</i>, with those that have some Shew of
<i>Piety</i>, whereof the most Part do defend <i>Swearing</i> before the Magistrate
with so great Zeal, that not only they are ready themselves to do it
upon every Occasion, but also have <span class="correction" title="In the original book: stired">stirred</span> up the Magistrates to persecute
those, who, out of Obedience to <i>Christ</i>, their Lord and Master,
judge it unlawful to <i>swear</i>; upon which Account not a Few have
suffered Imprisonment, and the Spoiling of their Goods.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>All Swearing is forbidden&mdash;</i></span>But considering these clear Words of our Saviour, <i>Matt.</i> v. 33, 34.
<i>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old Time, Thou shalt
not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths. But I say
unto you, <span class="smcap">Swear not at all</span>, neither by Heaven, </i>&amp;c.<i> But let your
Communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh
of Evil.</i> As also the Words of the Apostle <i>James</i> v. 12. <i>But above all
Things, my Brethren, swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth,
neither by any other Oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, lest ye
fall into Condemnation.</i> I say, considering these clear Words, it is admirable
how any one that professeth the <i>Name of Christ</i> can pronounce
any <i>Oath</i> with a quiet Conscience, far less to persecute other Christians,
that dare not <i>swear</i>, because of their Master <i>Christ</i>’s Authority.
For did any one purpose seriously, and in the most rigid Manner,
to forbid any Thing comprehended under any General, can they
use a more full and general Prohibition, and that without any Exception?
I think not. For Christ, <i>First</i>, proposeth it to us negatively,
<i>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, not by the Earth, nor by </i>Jerusalem<i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a>[Pg 477]</span>
nor by thy Head</i>, &amp;c. And again, <i>Swear not by Heaven, nor by
Earth, nor by any other Oath</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, He presseth it affirmatively,
<i>But let your Communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay; for whatsoever is more
than these, cometh of Evil.</i> And saith <i>James</i>, <i>Lest ye fall into Condemnation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Without Exception.</i></span>Which Words both all and every one of them do make such a
full Prohibition, and so free of all Exception, that it is strange how
Men that boast the Scripture is the <i>Rule</i> of their <i>Faith</i> and <i>Life</i>, can
counterfeit any Exception! Certainly <i>Reason</i> ought to teach every
one, that it is not lawful to make void a general Prohibition coming
from God by such Opposition, unless the Exception be as clearly
and evidently expressed as the Prohibition: Neither is it enough to
endeavour to confirm it by Consequences and Probabilities, which
are obscure and uncertain, and not sufficient to bring Quiet to the
<i>Conscience</i>. For if they say, That there is therefore an Exception and
Limitation in the Words, because there are found Exceptions in the
other general Prohibition of this <i>Fifth Chapter</i>, as in the forbidding
of <i>Divorcement</i>, where Christ saith, <i>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put
away his Wife, let him give her a Writing of Divorcement: But I say unto
you, That whosoever shall put away his Wife, saving for the Cause of Fornication,
causeth her to commit Adultery</i>; if, I say, they plead this, they
not only labour in vain, but also fight against themselves, because
they can produce no Exception of this general Command of <i>not
Swearing</i>, expressed by God to any under the <i>New Covenant</i>, after
<i>Christ</i> gave this Prohibition so clear as that which is made in the
Prohibition itself.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Also Oaths before a Magistrate.</i></span>Moreover, if <i>Christ</i> would have excepted <i>Oaths</i>
made before Magistrates, certainly he had then expressed, adding,
<i>Except in Judgment, before the Magistrate</i>, or the like; as he did in that
of <i>Divorcement</i> by these Words, <i>Saving for the Cause of Fornication</i>:
Which being so, it is not lawful for us to <i>except</i> or <i>distinguish</i>, or,
which is all one, <i>make void</i> this general Prohibition of Christ; it
would be far less agreeable to <i>Christian Holiness</i> to bring upon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a>[Pg 478]</span>
Heads the Crimes of so many <i>Oaths</i>, which by Reason of this Corruption
and Exception are so frequent among Christians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Concurrence of the ancient Fathers therein.</i></span>Neither is it to be omitted that without Doubt the most <i>learned
Doctors</i> of each Sect know, That these fore-mentioned Words were
understood by the <i>ancient Fathers</i> of the <i>first three hundred Years</i> after
Christ to be a Prohibition of all Sorts of <i>Oaths</i>. It is not then without
Reason that we wonder that the <i>Popish Doctors</i> and <i>Priests</i> bind
themselves by an <i>Oath</i> to interpret the <i>Holy Scriptures</i> according to
the universal Exposition of the <i>Holy Fathers</i>; who nevertheless understood
those controverted Texts quite contrary to what these <i>modern
Doctors</i> do. And from thence also do clearly appear the Vanity
and foolish Certainty (so to speak) of <i>Popish Traditions</i>; for if by the
Writings of the <i>Fathers</i>, so called, the Faith of the Church of those
Ages may be demonstrated, it is clear they have departed from the
Faith of the Church of the <i>first three Ages</i> in the Point of <i>Swearing</i>.
Moreover, because not only <i>Papists</i>, but also <i>Lutherans</i> and <i>Calvinists</i>,
and some others, do restrict the Words of <i>Christ</i> and <i>James</i>, I think
it needful to make manifest the vain Foundation upon which that
Presumption in this Matter is built.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XI.</h3>
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>First</i>, They object, <i>That Christ only forbids those Oaths that
are made by Creatures, and Things created</i>; and they prove it thence,
because he numbers some of these Things.</div>

<p>Secondly, <i>All rash and vain Oaths in familiar Discourses; because he
saith, Let your Communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ. 1.</i></span>To which I <i>answer</i>, <i>First</i>, That the <i>Law</i> did forbid all <i>Oaths</i> made
by the Creatures, as also all vain and rash <i>Oaths</i> in our common
Discourses, commanding, That Men should only <i>swear</i> by the Name
of God, and that neither falsely nor rashly; for that is to take his
Name in vain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ans.">Answ.</span> 2</i>.</span><i>Secondly</i>, It is most evident that Christ forbids somewhat that was
permitted under the <i>Law</i>,
<span class="sidenote"><i>To swear by God himself forbidden by Christ.</i></span>to wit, to <i>swear by the Name of God</i>, because
it was not lawful for any Man to <i>swear</i> but by God himself.
And because he saith, <i>Neither by Heaven, because it is the Throne of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a>[Pg 479]</span>
God</i>; therefore he excludes all other <i>Oaths</i>, even those which are
made by God; for he saith, Chap. xxiii. 22. <i>He that shall swear by
Heaven, sweareth by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon</i>:
Which is also to be understood of the rest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ans.">Answ.</span> 3.</i></span><i>Lastly</i>, That he might put the Matter beyond all Controversy, he
adds, <i>Neither by any other Oath</i>: Therefore seeing to <i>swear</i> before the
Magistrate by God is an <i>Oath</i>, it is here without Doubt forbidden.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object, <i>That by these Words Oaths by God’s Name cannot
be forbidden, because the Heavenly Father hath commanded them; for the
Father and the Son are one, which could not be, if the Son had forbid that
which the Father commanded</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, They are indeed one, and cannot contradict one another:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Oaths under the Old Covenant</i>.</span>Nevertheless the Father gave many Things to the Jews for a
Time, because of their Infirmity under the <i>Old Covenant</i>, which had
only a Shadow of good Things to come, not the very Substance
of Things, until Christ should come, who was the Substance, and
by whose Coming all these Things vanished, to wit, <i>Sabbaths</i>, <i>Circumcision</i>,
the <i>Paschal Lamb</i>: Men used then Sacrifices, who lived in
Controversies with God, and one with another, which all are abrogated
in the Coming of the Son, who is the Substance, Eternal
Word, and Essential Oath and Amen, in whom the <i>Promises of God
are Yea and Amen</i>: Who came that Men might be redeemed out of
Strife, and might make an End of Controversy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object, <i>But all Oaths are not Ceremonies, nor any Part
of the Ceremonial Law</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I answer, Except it be shewn to be an eternal, immutable, and
moral Precept, it withstands not; neither are they of so old an <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: Original">Origin</span>
as <i>Tithes</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Tithes,<i> &amp;c. unlawful now.</i></span>and the Offering of the <i>First Fruits</i> of the Ground,
which by <i>Abel</i> and <i>Cain</i> were offered long before the <i>Ceremonial Law</i>,
or the Use of <i>Oaths</i>; which, whatever may be alleged against it,
were no Doubt <i>Ceremonies</i>, and therefore no Doubt unlawful now to
be practised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a>[Pg 480]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They object, <i>That to swear by the Name of God is a moral
Precept of continual Duration, because it is marked with his essential and
moral Worship, </i>Deut. <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: vi. 12. and x. 22.">vi. 13. and x. 20.</span><i> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy
God, and serve him alone: Thou shalt cleave to him, and swear by his
Name</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, This proves not that it is a moral and eternal Precept;
for <i>Moses</i> adds that to all the Precepts and Ceremonies in several
Places; as <i>Deut.</i> x. 12, 13. saying, <i>And now, </i>Israel<i>, what doth the
Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all
his Ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,
and with all thy Soul; to keep the Commandments in the Lord, and his Statutes,
which I command thee this Day?</i> And <i>Chap.</i> xiv. 23. the <i>Fear of the
Lord</i> is mentioned together with the <i>Tithes</i>. And so also <i>Levit.</i> xix.
2, 3. 6. the <i>Sabbaths</i> and Regard to <i>Parents</i> are mentioned with
<i>Swearing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Fifthly</i>, They object, <i>That solemn Oaths, which God commanded, cannot
be here forbidden by Christ; for he saith, That they come from Evil: But these
did not come from Evil; for God never commanded any Thing that was Evil,
or came from Evil</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, There are Things which are <i>Good</i> because <i>commanded</i>,
and <i>Evil</i> because <i>forbidden</i>; other Things are <i>commanded</i> because <i>Good</i>,
and <i>forbidden</i> because <i>Evil</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Oaths are Evil, because forbidden.</i></span>As <i>Circumcision</i> and <i>Oaths</i>, which were
<i>Good</i>, when and because they were <i>commanded</i>, and in no other Respect;
and again, when and because prohibited under the Gospel,
they are <i>Evil</i>.</p>

<p>And in all these <i>Jewish Constitutions</i>, however ceremonial, there
was something of Good, to wit, in their Season, as prefiguring
some Good: As by <i>Circumcision</i>, the <i>Purifications</i>, and other Things,
the Holiness of God was typified, and that the <i>Israelites</i> ought to be
<i>holy</i>, <i>as their God was holy</i>. In the like Manner <i>Oaths</i>, under the <i>Shadows</i>
and <i>Ceremonies</i>, signified the <i>Verity of God</i>, his Faithfulness and
Certainty; and therefore that we ought in all Things to speak and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a>[Pg 481]</span>
witness the Truth.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Truth was before all Oaths.</i></span>But the <i>Witness of Truth</i> was before all <i>Oaths</i>, and
remains when all <i>Oaths</i> are abolished; and this is the Morality of
all <i>Oaths</i>; and so long as Men abide therein, there is no Necessity
nor Place for <i>Oaths</i>, as <i>Polybius</i> witnessed, who said, “The Use of
<i>Oaths </i>in Judgment<i> was rare among the Ancients; but by the growing
</i>of<i> Perfidiousness, </i>so grew also the Use of<i> Oaths</i>.”
<span class="sidenote">Oaths<i> supply presupposed Defects of Men’s Inconstancy.</i></span>To which
agreeth <i>Grotius</i>, saying, “An Oath is only to be used as a Medicine,
in Case of Necessity: A solemn Oath is not used but to supply
Defect. The Lightness of Men, and their Inconstancy, begot
Diffidence; for which Swearing was sought out as a Remedy.”
<i>Basil</i> the Great saith, “That Swearing is the Effect of Sin.” And
<i>Ambrose</i>, “That Oaths are only a Condescendency for Defect.” <i>Chrysostom</i>
saith, “That an Oath entered when Evil grew, when Men
exercised their Frauds, when all Foundations were overturned:
That Oaths took their Beginning from the Want of Truth.” These
and the Like are witnessed by many others with the fore-mentioned
Authors. But what Need of Testimonies, where the Evidence of
Things speaks itself? For who will force another to <i>swear</i>, of whom
he is certainly persuaded that he abhors to <i>lie</i> in his Words? And
again, as <i>Chrysostom</i> and others say, “For what End wilt thou force
him to swear, whom thou believest not that he will speak the
Truth?”</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XII.</h3> That then which was not from the <i>Beginning</i>, which was
of no Use in the <i>Beginning</i>, which had not its <i>Beginning</i> first from the
Will of God, but from the Work of the Devil, occasioned from Evil,
to wit, from <i>Unfaithfulness</i>, <i>Lying</i>, <i>Deceit</i>; and which was at first only
invented by Man, as a mutual Remedy of this Evil, in which they
called upon the Names of their <i>Idols</i>; yea, that which, as <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Hierom"><i>Jerome</i></span>, <i>Chrysostom</i>,
and others testify, was given to the <i>Israelites</i> by God, as unto
Children, that they might abstain from the <i>idolatrous Oaths</i> of the <i>Heathens</i>,
Jer. xii. 16. whatsoever is so, is far from being a moral and eternal
Precept. And <i>Lastly</i>, whatsoever by its Profanation and Abuse is
polluted with Sin, such as are abundantly the <i>Oaths</i> of these Times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a>[Pg 482]</span>
by so often <i>swearing</i> and <i>forswearing</i>, far differs from any necessary
and perpetual Duty of a Christian: But <i>Oaths</i> are so: Therefore, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Sixthly</i>, They object, <i>That God swore, </i>therefore<i> to swear is good</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>Athan.</i> in pass. &amp; cruc. Dom.</span>
I <i>answer</i> with <i>Athanasius</i>; “Seeing it is certain it is proper in
Swearing to swear by another, thence it appears, that God, to
speak properly, did never swear but <i>only</i> improperly: Whence,
speaking to Men, he is said to swear, because those Things which
he speaks, because of the Certainty and Immutability of his Will,
are to be esteemed for Oaths.” Compare <i>Psalm</i> cx. 4. where it is
said, <i>The Lord did swear, and it did not repent him</i>, &amp;c.
<span class="sidenote"><i>God swears not by another, but by himself.</i></span>And <i>I swore
</i>(saith he)<i> by myself</i>: “And this is not an Oath; for he did not
swear by another, which is the Property of an Oath, but by
himself. Therefore God swears not according to the Manner of
Men, neither can we be induced from thence to swear. But let
us so do and say, and shew ourselves such by speaking and acting,
that we need not an Oath with those who hear us; and let our
Words of themselves have the Testimony of Truth: For so we
shall plainly imitate God.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Seventhly</i>, They object, <i>Christ did swear, and we ought to imitate him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, That Christ did not swear; and albeit he had sworn,
being yet under the Law, this would no Ways oblige us under the
Gospel; as neither <i>Circumcision</i>, or the Celebration of the <i>Paschal Lamb</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Hier."><i>Jerome</i></span> Lib. Ep. Part. 3. Tract. 1. Ep. 2.</span>Concerning which <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Hierom"><i>Jerome</i></span> saith, “All Things agree not unto us,

swore as Lord, whom no Man did forbid to swear; but unto us,
that are Servants, it is not lawful to swear, because we are forbidden
by the Law of our Lord. Yet, lest we should suffer Scandal
by his Example, he hath not sworn, since he commanded us
not to swear.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Eighthly</i>, They object, <i>That </i>Paul<i> swore, and that often</i>, Rom. i. 9.
Phil. i. 8. saying, <i>For God is my Record</i>. 2 Cor. <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: ix.">xi.</span> 10. <i>As the Truth

by the Lord, that this Epistle be read to all the Brethren. But </i>Paul<i> would
not have done so, if all Manner of Oaths had been forbidden by Christ, whose
Apostle he was.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>To all which I <i>answer</i>, <i>First</i>, That the using of such Forms of
Speaking is neither <i>Swearing</i>, nor so esteemed by our Adversaries.
For when upon Occasion, in Matters of great Moment, we have
said, <i>We speak the Truth in the Fear of God, and before him, who is our
Witness, and the Searcher of our Hearts</i>, adding such Kind of serious
Attestations, which we never refused in Matters of Consequence;
nevertheless an <i>Oath</i> hath moreover been required of us,
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Ceremonies of an</i> Oath.</span>with the
Ceremony of putting our Hands upon the Book, the Kissing of it,
the lifting up of the Hand or Fingers, together with this common
Form of Imprecation, <i>So help me God</i>; or, <i>So truly Let the Lord God Almighty
help me</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, This contradicts the Opinion of our Adversaries,
because that <i>Paul</i> was neither before a Magistrate that was requiring
an Oath of him, nor did he himself administer the Office of
a Magistrate, as offering an <i>Oath</i> to any other. <i>Thirdly</i>, The Question
is not what <i>Paul</i> or <i>Peter</i> did, but what their and our Master
taught to be done; and if <i>Paul</i> did <i>swear</i> (which we believe not) he
had sinned against the Command of Christ, even according to their
own Opinion, because he <i>swore</i> not before a <i>Magistrate</i>, but in an
<i>Epistle</i> to his Brethren.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Ninthly</i>, They object, <i>Isa.</i> lxv. 16. where speaking of the Evangelical
Times, he saith, <i>That he who blesseth himself in the Earth, shall bless
himself in the God of Truth; and he that sweareth in the Earth, shall swear by
the God of Truth; because the former Troubles are forgotten, and because they
are hid from mine Eyes. For behold I create new Heavens, and a new
Earth. Therefore in these Times we ought to swear by the Name of the
Lord.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, It is ordinary for the Prophets to express the greatest
Duties of the <i>Evangelical Times</i> in <i>Mosaical</i> Terms, as appears among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a>[Pg 484]</span>
others from <i>Jer.</i> xxxi. 38, 39, 40. <i>Ezek.</i> xxxvi. 25. and 40. and <i>Isa.</i>
xlv. 23. <i>I have sworn by myself, that unto me every Knee shall bow, every
Tongue shall swear.</i> Where the Righteousness of the <i>New Jerusalem</i>,
the Purity of the <i>Gospel</i>, with its <i>spiritual Worship</i>, and the Profession
of the <i>Name of Christ</i>, are expressed under Forms of Speaking used to
the <i>Old Jerusalem</i> under the Washings of the Law, under the Names
of Ceremonies, the Temple, Services, Sacrifices, Oaths, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<span class="sidenote">Swearing<i> is expressed by </i>Confessing<i> under the Gospel.</i></span>Yea,
that which the Prophet speaks here of <i>Swearing</i>, the Apostle <i>Paul</i>
interprets expresly of <i>Confessing</i>, saying, <i>Rom.</i> xiv. 11. <i>For it is written,
As I live, saith the Lord, every Knee shall bow to me, and every Tongue
shall confess to God</i>: Which being rightly considered, none can be
ignorant but these Words which the Prophet writes under the Law,
when the ceremonial Oaths were in Use, to wit, <i>Every Tongue shall
swear</i>, were by the Apostle, being under the Gospel, when those
<i>Oaths</i> became abolished, expressed by, <i>Every Tongue shall confess</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Tenthly</i>, They object, <i>But the Apostle </i>Paul<i> approves Oaths used among
Men, when he writes, </i>Heb. vi. 16.<i> For Men verily swear by the greater,
and an Oath for Confirmation is to them an End of all Strife. But there are
as many Contests, Fallacies, and Differences at this Time as there ever were;
therefore the Necessity of Oaths doth yet remain.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; The Apostle tells indeed in this Place what Men at that
Time did, who lived in Controversies and Incredulity; not what
they ought to have done, nor what the Saints did, who were redeemed
from Strife and Incredulity, and had come to Christ, the
Truth and Amen of God. Moreover, he only alludes to a certain
Custom usual among Men, that he might express the Firmness of
the <i>Divine Promise</i>, in order to excite in the Saints so much the more
<i>Confidence</i> in God promising to them; not that he might instigate
them to <i>swear</i> against the Law of God, or confirm them in that;
no, not at all: For neither doth 1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 24. teach Christians the
vain Races, whereby Men oftentimes, even to the Destruction of
their Bodies, are wearied to obtain a corruptible Prize; so neither
doth Christ, who is the <i>Prince of Peace</i>, teach his Disciples to fight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a>[Pg 485]</span>
albeit he takes Notice, <i>Luke</i> xiv. 31. what it behoveth such Kings to
do who are accustomed to fight, as prudent Warriors therein. <i>Secondly</i>,
As to what pertains to <i>Contests</i>, <i>Perfidies</i>, and <i>Diffidences</i> among
Men, which our Adversaries affirm to have grown to such an Height,
that <i>Swearing</i> is at present as necessary as ever, that we deny not at
all:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Deceit among the False, not the true Christians.</i></span>For we see, and daily Experience teacheth us, that all Manner
of Deceit and Malice doth increase among worldly Men and false
Christians; but not among true Christians. But because Men
cannot trust one another, and therefore require <i>Oaths</i> one of another,
it will not therefore follow, That true Christians ought to do
so, whom Christ has brought to Faithfulness and Honesty, as well
towards God as one towards another, and therefore has delivered
them from <i>Contests</i>, <i>Perfidies</i>, and consequently from <i>Oaths</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Eleventhly</i>, They object, <i>We grant, That among true Christians there is not
Need of Oaths; but by what Means shall we infallibly know them? It will
follow then that Oaths are at present needful, and that it is lawful for Christians
to swear; to wit, that such may be satisfied who will not acknowledge
this and the other Man to be a Christian.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>Truth was before Oaths.</i></span>
I <i>answer</i>, It is no Ways lawful for a Christian to <i>swear</i>, whom
Christ has called to his essential Truth, which was before all <i>Oaths</i>,
forbidding him to <i>swear</i>; and on the contrary, commanding him to
speak the Truth in all Things, to the Honour of Christ who called
him; that it may appear that the <i>Words</i> of his Disciples may be as
truly believed as the <i>Oaths</i> of all the worldly Men. Neither is it
lawful for them to be unfaithful in this, that they may please others,
or that they may avoid their Hurt: For thus the Primitive Christians
for some Ages remained faithful, who being required to <i>swear</i>, did
unanimously answer, <i>I am a Christian, I do not swear</i>. What shall I
say of the <i>Heathens</i>, some of whom arrived to that Degree? For <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i> relates, Lib. 16.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Heathen Testimonies against Oaths.</i></span>“That the giving of the Right-hand
was, among the <i>Persians</i>, a Sign of speaking the Truth.” And the
<i>Scythians</i>, as <i>Qu. Curtius</i> relates, said, in their Conferences with <i>Alexander</i>
the Great, “Think not that the <i>Scythians</i> confirm their Friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a>[Pg 486]</span>ship
by Swearing; they swear by keeping their Promises.” <i>Stobæus,
Serm.</i> 3. relates, That <i>Solon</i> said, “A good Man ought to be
in that Estimation that he need not an Oath; because it is to be
reputed a Lessening of his Honour if he be forced to swear.” <i>Pythagoras</i>,
in his Oration, among other Things hath this Maxim, as
that which concerns the Administration of the Commonwealth:
“Let no Man call God to witness by an Oath, no not in Judgment;
but let every Man so accustom himself to speak, that he
may become worthy to be trusted even without an Oath.” <i>Basil</i>
the Great commends <i>Clinias</i> an Heathen, “That he had rather pay
three Talents, which are about <i>three thousand Pounds</i>, than swear.”
<i>Socrates</i>, as <i>Stobæus</i> relates, <i>Serm.</i> 14. had this Sentence, “The Duty
of good Men requires that they shew to the World that their Manners
and Actions are more firm than Oaths.” The same was the
Judgment of <i>Isocrates</i>. <i>Plato</i> also stood against <i>Oaths</i> in his Judgment
<i>de Leg.</i> 12. <i>Quintilianus</i> takes Notice, “That it was of old a Kind of
Infamy, if any was desired to swear; but to require an Oath of
a Nobleman, was like an examining him by the Hangman.”
The Emperor <i>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</i> saith, in his Description of a
good Man, “Such is his Integrity, that he needs not an Oath.”
So also some <i>Jews</i> did witness, as <i>Grotius</i> relates out of <i>Maimonides</i>,
“It is best for a Man to abstain from all Oaths.” The <i>Essenes</i>, as
<i>Philo Judæus</i> relates, “Did esteem their Words more firm than Oaths;
and Oaths were esteemed among them as needless Things.” And
<i>Philo</i> himself, speaking of the Third Commandment, explains his
Mind thus, <i>viz.</i> “It were better altogether not to swear, but to be
accustomed always to speak the Truth, that naked Words might
have the Strength of an Oath.” And elsewhere he saith, “It is
more agreeable to natural Reason altogether to abstain from
Swearing; <i>persuading</i>, That whatsoever a good Man saith may be
equivalent with an Oath.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Oaths<i> abrogated by Christ.</i></span>Who then needs further to doubt, but that since Christ would
have his Disciples attain the highest Pitch of Perfection, he abro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a>[Pg 487]</span>gated
<i>Oaths</i>, as a Rudiment of Infirmity, and in Place thereof established
the Use of <i>Truth</i>? Who can now any more think that the
<i>holy Martyrs</i> and <i>ancient Fathers</i> of the first three hundred Years, and
many others since that Time, have so opposed themselves to <i>Oaths</i>,
that they might only rebuke vain and rash <i>Oaths</i> by the Creatures,
or Heathen Idols, which were also prohibited under the <i>Mosaical
Law</i>; and not also <i>Swearing</i> by the true God, in Truth and Righteousness,
which was there commanded?

Is it not rather Time that all good Men should labour to remove
this Abuse and Infamy from <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: the Christians"><i>Christians</i></span>?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a>[Pg 488]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Lastly</i>, They object, <i>This will bring in Fraud and Confusion; for Impostors
will counterfeit Probity, and under the Benefit of this Dispensation will
lie without Fear of Punishment</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><i>I answer</i>, There are two Things which oblige a Man to speak the
Truth: <i>First</i>, Either the Fear of God in his Heart, and Love of
Truth; for where this is, there is no Need of <i>Oaths</i> to speak the
Truth;
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Punishment of Liars.</i></span>or, <i>Secondly</i>, The Fear of Punishment from the Judge.
Therefore let there be the same, or rather greater Punishment appointed
to those who pretend so great Truth in Words, and so
great Simplicity in Heart that they cannot lie, and so great Reverence
towards the Law of Christ, that for Conscience Sake they deny
to <i>swear</i> in any wise, if they fail; and so there shall be the same
good Order, yea, greater Security against Deceivers, as if <i>Oaths</i>
were continued; and also, by that more severe Punishment, to
which these false Dissemblers shall be liable. Hence wicked Men
shall be more terrified, and good Men delivered from all Oppression,
both in their Liberty and Goods: For which Respect to tender
<i>Consciences</i>, God hath often a Regard to Magistrates and their
State, as a Thing most acceptable to him. But if any can further
doubt of this Thing, to wit, if without Confusion it can be practised
in the Commonwealth, let him consider the State of the <i>United
Netherlands</i>, and he shall see the good Effect of it:
<span class="sidenote"><i>The United Netherlands instanced.</i></span>For there, because
of the great Number of Merchants more than in any other Place,
there is most frequent Occasion for this Thing; and though the
Number of those that are of this Mind be considerable, to whom the
States these hundred Years have condescended, and yet daily condescend,
yet nevertheless there has nothing of Prejudice followed
thereupon to the Commonwealth, Government, or good Order;
but rather great Advantage to <i>Trade</i>, and so to the Commonwealth.</p>



<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline">§. XIII.</h3> <i>Sixthly</i>, The last Thing to be considered, is <i>Revenge</i> and
<i>War</i>, an Evil as opposite and contrary to the Spirit and Doctrine
of Christ as <i>Light</i> to <i>Darkness</i>. For, as is manifest by what is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a>[Pg 489]</span>
through Contempt of Christ’s Law the whole World is filled with
various <i>Oaths</i>, <i>Cursings</i>, <i>blasphemous Profanations</i>, and <i>horrid Perjuries</i>;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Revenge and War contrary to Christ.</i></span>so likewise, through Contempt of the same Law, the World is filled
with <i>Violence</i>, <i>Oppression</i>, <i>Murders</i>, <i>Ravishing of Women</i> and <i>Virgins</i>, <i>Spoilings</i>,
<i>Depredations</i>, <i>Burnings</i>, <i>Devastations</i>, and all Manner of <i>Lasciviousness</i>
and <i>Cruelty</i>: So that it is strange that Men, made after the
Image of God, should have so much degenerated, that they rather
bear the Image and Nature of roaring Lions, tearing Tigers, devouring
Wolves, and raging Boars, than of rational Creatures endued
with Reason. And is it not yet much more admirable, that
this <i>horrid Monster</i> should find Place, and be fomented, among those
Men that profess themselves <i>Disciples</i> of our <i>peaceable Lord</i> and <i>Master</i>
Jesus Christ, who by <i>Excellency</i> is called the <i>Prince of Peace</i>, and hath
expresly prohibited his Children <i>all</i> Violence; and on the contrary,
commanded them, that, according to his Example, they should follow
Patience, Charity, Forbearance, and other Virtues worthy of
a Christian?</div>

<p>Hear then what this great Prophet saith, whom every Soul is
commanded to hear, under the Pain of being cut off, <i>Matt.</i> v. from
Verse 38. to the End of the Chapter.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Revenge forbidden by Christ.</i></span>For thus he saith: <i>Ye have
heard that it hath been said, An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth:
But I say unto you, that ye resist not Evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on
thy right Cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any Man will sue thee
at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak also. And whosoever
shall compel thee to go a Mile, go with him twain. Give to him that
asketh thee; and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.
Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour, and hate
thine Enemy: But I say unto you, Love your Enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you, that ye may be the Children of your Father which is in
Heaven. For he maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good, and
sendeth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust. For if ye love them which love
you, what Reward have ye? Do not even the </i>Publicans<i> the same? And if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a>[Pg 490]</span>
ye salute your Brethren only, what do you more than</i> others? <i>Do not even
the </i>Publicans<i> so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
Heaven is perfect.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Law of Christ more perfect than that of </i>Moses.</span>These Words, with Respect to <i>Revenge</i>, as the former in the Case
of <i>Swearing</i>, do forbid some Things, which in Time past were lawful
to the <i>Jews</i>, considering their Condition and Dispensation;
and command unto such as will be the Disciples of Christ, a more
perfect, eminent, and full Signification of Charity, as also Patience
and Suffering, than was required of them in that Time, State, and

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Laws of Christ in the New Testament are irreconcileable to Persecution, Wars, and Fighting.</i></span>From hence it appears, that there is so great a Connexion betwixt
these two Precepts of <i>Christ</i>, that as they were uttered and
commanded by him at one and the same Time, so the same Way
they were received by Men of all Ages, not only in the first Promulgation
by the little Number of the Disciples, but also after the
Christians increased in the first three hundred Years. Even so in
the <i>Apostasy</i>, the one was not left and rejected without the other;
and now again in the <i>Restitution</i>, and renewed Preaching of the
<i>Eternal Gospel</i>, they are acknowledged as eternal and unchangeable
Laws, properly belonging to the <i>Evangelical State</i> and <i>Perfection</i>
thereof; from which if any withdraw, he falls short of the Perfection
of a <i>Christian Man</i>.</p>

<p>And truly the Words are so clear in themselves, that, in my
Judgment, they need no Illustration to explain their Sense: For it
is as easy to reconcile the greatest Contradictions, as these Laws of
our Lord Jesus Christ with the wicked Practices of <i>Wars</i>; for they
are plainly inconsistent. Whoever can reconcile this, <i>Resist not
Evil</i>, with <i>resist Violence by Force</i>: again, <i>Give also thy other Cheek</i>, with
<i>strike again</i>; also <i>Love thine Enemies</i>, with <i>spoil them, make a Prey of
them, pursue them with Fire and Sword</i>; or, <i>Pray for those that persecute
you, and those that calumniate you</i>, with <i>persecute them by Fines, Imprisonments,
and Death itself</i>; and not only such as do not <i>persecute you</i>,
but <i>who heartily seek and desire your eternal and temporal Welfare</i>: Whoever,
I say, can find a Means to reconcile these Things, may be supposed
also to have found a Way to reconcile <i>God</i> with the <i>Devil</i>,
<i>Christ</i> with <i>Antichrist</i>, <i>Light</i> with <i>Darkness</i>, and <i>Good</i> with <i>Evil</i>. But if
this be impossible, as indeed it is, so will also the other be impossible;
and Men do but deceive themselves and others, while they
boldly adventure to establish such absurd and impossible Things.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Obj. 4.</span>But they object, <i>That it is lawful to War, because </i>Abraham<i>
did war before the giving of the Law, and the </i>Israelites<i> after the giving
of the Law</i>.</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i> as before, 1. That <i>Abraham</i> offered Sacrifices at that
Time, and circumcised the Males; which nevertheless are not lawful
for us under the Gospel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Israelites going to War enquired of the Oracle of God.</i></span>2. That neither defensive nor offensive War was lawful to the
<i>Israelites</i> of their own Will, or by their own Counsel or Conduct;
but they were obliged at all Times, if they would be successful,
first to enquire of the <i>Oracle of God</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a>[Pg 494]</span></p>

<p>3. That their Wars against the wicked Nations were a Figure
of the Inward War of the true Christians against their Spiritual
Enemies, in which we overcome the Devil, the World, and the
Flesh.</p>

<p>4. Something is expresly forbidden by Christ, <i>Mat.</i> v. 38, <i>&amp;c.</i>
which was granted to the <i>Jews</i> in their Time, because of their Hardness;
<span class="sidenote"><i>Some Things permitted in the Old Testament, because of Hardness of Heart.</i></span>and on the Contrary, we are commanded that singular Patience
and Exercise of Love, which <i>Moses</i> commanded not to his Disciples.
From whence <i>Tertullian</i> saith well against <i>Marc.</i> “Christ
truly teacheth a new Patience, even forbidding the Revenge of an
Injury, which was permitted by the Creator.” And <i>Lib. de Patien.</i>
“The Law finds more than it lost, by Christ saying,” <i>Love your Enemies</i>.
And in the Time of <i>Clem. Alex.</i> Christians were so far from
Wars, that he testified that they had no Marks or Signs of Violence
among them, saying, “Neither are the Faces of Idols to be painted,
to which so much as to regard is forbidden: Neither Sword nor
Bow to them that follow Peace; nor Cups to them who are moderate
and temperate,” as <i>Sylvius Disc. de Rev. Belg.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Secondly</i>, They object, <i>That Defence is of natural Right, and that Religion
destroys not Nature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, Be it so; but to obey God, and commend ourselves to
him in Faith and Patience, is not to destroy Nature, but to exalt
and perfect it; to wit, to elevate it from the natural to the supernatural
Life, by Christ living therein, and comforting it, that it
may do all Things, and be rendered more than Conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Thirdly</i>, They object, <i>That </i>John<i> did not abrogate or condemn </i>War<i>,
when the Soldiers came unto him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>, What then? The Question is not concerning <i>John</i>’s Doctrine,
but <i>Christ</i>’s, whose Disciples we are, not <i>John</i>’s: For <i>Christ</i>,
and not <i>John</i>, is that Prophet, whom we ought all to hear. And
although Christ said, <a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a><i>That a greater than </i>John<i> the Baptist was not among
Men born of Women</i>; yet he adds, <i>That the least in the Kingdom of God is
greater than he</i>. But what was <i>John</i>’s Answer, that we may see if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a>[Pg 495]</span>
can justify the Soldiers of this Time? For if it be narrowly observed,
it will appear, that what he proposeth to Soldiers doth manifestly
forbid them that Employment; for he commands them <a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a><i>not to do
Violence to any Man, nor to defraud any Man</i>; but that they <i>be content
with their Wages</i>. Consider then what he dischargeth to Soldiers, <i>viz.</i>
Not to use Violence or Deceit against any; which being removed,
let any tell how Soldiers can war? For is not <i>Craft</i>, <i>Violence</i>, and <i>Injustice</i>,
three Properties of <i>War</i>, and the natural Consequences of
<i>Battles</i>?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Fourthly</i>, They object, <i>That </i>Cornelius<i>, and that Centurion, of whom
there is Mention made, </i>Mat. viii. 5.<i> were Soldiers; and there is no Mention
that they laid down their military Employments</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; Neither read we that they continued in them. But it
is most probable that if they continued in the Doctrine of Christ
(and we read not any where of their Falling from the Faith) that they
did not continue in them; especially if we consider, that two or
three Ages afterwards <i>Christians</i> altogether rejected War, or at least
a long While after that Time, if the Emperor <i>Marc. Aurel. Anton.</i>
be to be credited, who writes thus:&mdash;&mdash;“I prayed to my Country
Gods; but when I was neglected by them, and observed myself
pressed by the Enemy; considering the Fewness of my Forces, I
called to one, and intreated those, who with us are called <i>Christians</i>,
and I found a great Number of them:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Christians instanced, that did not War</i>.</span>And I forced them with
Threats, which ought not to have been, because afterwards I knew
their Strength and Force:” Therefore they betook themselves neither
to the Use of Darts nor Trumpets, “for they use not so to do,
for the Cause and Name of their God, which they bear in their
Consciences:” And this was done about an hundred and sixty
Years after Christ. To this add those Words, which in <i>Justin Martyr</i>
the Christians answer, [Greek: ou polemoumen tois echthrois: ου πολεμουμεν τοις εχθροις], that is, <i>We fight not with
our Enemies</i>. And moreover the Answer of <i>Martin</i> to <i>Julian</i> the
Apostate, related by <i>Sulpitius Severus</i>: “I am a Soldier of Christ,
therefore I cannot fight;” which was three hundred Years after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a>[Pg 496]</span>
<i>Christ</i>. It is not therefore probable that they continued in warlike
Employments. How then are <i>Vincentius Lyrinensis</i> and the <i>Papists</i>
consistent with their Maxim, “That which always, every where,
and by all was received,” <i>&amp;c.</i> And what becomes of the <i>Priests</i>,
with their Oath, “That they neither ought nor will interpret the
Scripture, but according to the universal Consent of the Fathers,”
so called? “For it is as easy to obscure the Sun at Mid-day, as
to deny that the <i>Primitive Christians</i> renounced all Revenge and
War.”</p>

<p>And although this Thing be so much known; yet it is as well known
that almost all the modern Sects live in the Neglect and Contempt
of this Law of Christ, and likewise oppress others, who in this agree
not with them for Conscience Sake towards God:
<span class="sidenote"><i>Persecution for not bearing Arms, and not Fasting and Praying for Victory.</i></span>Even as we have
suffered much in our Country, because <i>we neither could ourselves bear
Arms, nor send others in our Place, nor give our Money for the buying of
Drums, Standards, and other Military Attire</i>. And lastly, <i>Because we
could not hold our Doors, Windows, and Shops close, for Conscience Sake, upon
such Days as Fasts and Prayers were appointed, to desire a Blessing upon,
and Success for the Arms of the Kingdom or Commonwealth under which we
live; neither give Thanks for the Victories acquired by the Effusion of much
Blood</i>. By which forcing of the Conscience, they would have constrained
our Brethren, living in divers Kingdoms, at War together,
to have implored our God for contrary and contradictory Things,
and consequently impossible; for it is impossible, that two Parties
fighting together, should both obtain the Victory. And because we
cannot concur with them in this Confusion, therefore we are subject
to <i>Persecution</i>. Yea, and others, who with us do witness that the
Use of Arms is unlawful to <i>Christians</i>, do look asquint upon us:
But which of us two do most faithfully observe this Testimony against
Arms? Either they, who at certain Times, at the Magistrate’s Order,
do close up their Shops and Houses, and meet in their Assembly,
praying for the Prosperity of their Arms, or giving Thanks for some
Victory or other, whereby they make themselves like to those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a>[Pg 497]</span>
approve Wars and Fighting; or we, who cannot do these Things for the
same Cause of Conscience, lest we should destroy, by our Works, what we
establish in Words; we shall leave to the Judgment of all prudent Men.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Fifthly</i>, They object, <i>That Christ, </i>Luke xxii. 36.<i> speaking to his Disciples,
commands them, That he that then had not a Sword, should sell his Coat,
and by a Sword: Therefore, </i>say they<i>, Arms are lawful</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span>I <i>answer</i>; Some indeed understand this of the <i>outward Sword</i>, nevertheless
regarding only that Occasion; otherwise judging, that Christians
are prohibited Wars under the Gospel. Among which is
<i>Ambrose</i>, who upon this Place speaks thus: “O Lord! Why commandest
thou me to buy a Sword, who forbiddest me to smite with
it? Why commandest thou me to have it, whom thou prohibitest
to draw it? Unless perhaps a Defence be prepared, not a necessary
Revenge; and that I may seem to have been able to revenge, but
that I would not. For the Law forbids me to smite again; and
therefore perhaps he said to <i>Peter</i>, offering two Swords, [It is
enough] as if it had been lawful, until the Gospel-times, that in
the Law there might be a Learning of Equity, but in the Gospel
a Perfection of Goodness.”
<span class="sidenote">Peter<i> offered two Swords.</i></span>Others judge Christ to have spoken
here mystically, and not according to the Letter; as <i>Origen</i> upon
<i>Mat.</i> xix. saying, <i>If any looking to the Letter, and not understanding the
Will of the Words, shall sell his bodily Garment, and buy a Sword, taking the
Words of Christ contrary to his Will, he shall perish; but concerning which
Sword he speaks, is not proper here to mention</i>. And truly when we
consider the Answer of the Disciples, <i>Master, behold, here are two
Swords</i>; understanding it of outward Swords; and again Christ’s Answer,
<i>It is enough</i>; it seems that Christ would not that the Rest, who
had not Swords (for they had only two Swords) should sell their
Coats, and buy an outward Sword. Who can think that, Matters
standing thus, he should have said, <i>Two was enough</i>? But however it
is sufficient that the Use of Arms is <span class="correction" title="Erratum: originally: lawful">unlawful</span> under the Gospel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Object.</span><i>Sixthly</i>, They object, <i>That the Scriptures and old Fathers</i>, so called,
<i>did only prohibit private Revenge, not the Use of Arms for the Defence of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a>[Pg 498]</span>
Country, Body, Wives, Children and Goods, when the Magistrate commands
it, seeing the Magistrate ought to be obeyed; therefore although it be not lawful
for private Men to do it of themselves, nevertheless they are bound to do it by
the Command of the Magistrate</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></span><span class="sidenote"><i>Christian Magistrates ought to obey the Command of their Master </i>Christ.</span>
I <i>Answer</i>; If the Magistrate be truly a Christian, or desires to be
so, he ought himself, in the first Place, to obey the Command of his
Master, saying, <i>Love your Enemies</i>, &amp;c. and then he could not command
us to kill them; but if he be not a true Christian, then ought
we to obey our <i>Lord</i> and <i>King</i>, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, whom he ought also to
obey: For in the Kingdom of Christ all ought to submit to his
Laws, from the highest to the lowest, that is, from the <i>King</i> to the
<i>Beggar</i>, and from <i>Cæsar</i> to the <i>Clown</i>. But alas! Where shall we
find such an Obedience?
<span class="sidenote">Lud. Vives <i>against Arms</i>.</span>O desperate Fall! Concerning which
<i>Ludov. Viv.</i> writes well, <i>Lib. de Con. Vit. Christ. sub Turc.</i> by Relation
of <i>Fredericus Sylvius</i>, Disc. de Revol. <i>Belg.</i> P. 85. “The Prince entered
into the Church, not as a true and plain Christian, which had
indeed been most happy and desirable; but he brought in with
him his Nobility, his Honours, his ARMS, his Ensigns, his Triumphs,
his Haughtiness, his Pride, his Superciliousness; <i>that is</i>,
He came into the House of Christ, accompanied with the Devil;
and which could no ways be done, he would have joined two
Houses and two Cities together, God’s and the Devil’s, which
could not more be done, than <i>Rome</i> and <i>Constantinople</i>, which are
distant by so long a Tract both of Sea and Land. (What Communion,
saith <i>Paul</i>, is there betwixt Christ and <i>Belial</i>?) Their
Zeal cooled by degrees, their Faith decreased, their whole Piety
degenerated; instead <i>whereof</i> we make now use of Shadows and
Images, and (as he saith) I would we could but retain these.”
Thus far <i>Vives</i>. But <i>Lastly</i>, as to what relates to this Thing, since
nothing seems more contrary to Man’s Nature, and seeing of all
Things the Defence of one’s self seems most tolerable, as it is most
hard to Men, so it is the most perfect Part of the Christian Religion,
as that wherein the <i>denial of Self</i> and <i>entire Confidence in God</i> doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a>[Pg 499]</span>
most appear; and therefore Christ and his Apostles left us hereof a
most perfect Example.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Concerning the present Magistrates of the Christian World.</i></span>As to what relates to the present Magistrates
of the <i>Christian World</i>, albeit we deny them not altogether the Name
of <i>Christians</i>, because of the publick Profession they make of <i>Christ’s
Name</i>, yet we may boldly affirm, that they are far from the Perfection
of the <i>Christian Religion</i>; because in the State in which they are
(as in many Places before I have largely observed) they have not
come to the pure Dispensation of the Gospel. And therefore, while
they are in that Condition, we shall not say, That <i>War</i>, undertaken
upon a just Occasion, is altogether unlawful to them. For even as
Circumcision and the other Ceremonies were for a Season permitted
to the <i>Jews</i>, not because they were either necessary of themselves,
or lawful at that Time, after the Resurrection of Christ, but
because that Spirit was not yet raised up in them, whereby they
could be delivered from such Rudiments; so the present Confessors
of the <i>Christian Name</i>, who are yet in the Mixture, and not in the
patient suffering Spirit, are not yet fitted for this Form of Christianity,
and therefore cannot be undefending themselves, until they
attain that Perfection. But for such whom Christ has brought
hither, it is not lawful to defend themselves by <i>Arms</i>, but they
ought overall to trust to the Lord.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><i>The Conclusion.</i></span>But <i>Lastly</i>, to conclude, If to give and receive flattering

outward and perishing Things, to go a Warring one against another,
whom we never saw, nor with whom we never had any Contest,
nor any Thing to do; being moreover altogether ignorant of the
Cause of the War, but only that the Magistrates of the Nations foment
Quarrels one against another, the Causes whereof are for the
most Part unknown to the Soldiers that fight, as well as upon whose
Side the right or wrong is; and yet to be so furious, and rage one
against another, to destroy and spoil all, that this or the other Worship
may be received or abolished; if to do this, and much more of
this Kind, be to fulfil the Law of Christ, then are our Adversaries
indeed true <i>Christians</i>, and we miserable <i>Hereticks</i>, that suffer ourselves
to be spoiled, taken, imprisoned, banished, beaten, and evilly entreated,
without any Resistance, <i>placing our Trust only in GOD</i>, that

all these Things, for Christ’s Sake, to the crucifying of our own
Lusts, and to the procuring to ourselves Shame, Reproach, Hatred,
and Ill-will from the Men of this World: Not as if by so doing we
judged to merit Heaven, but as knowing they are contrary to the
Will of Him who redeems his Children from the Love of this World,

which they take delight to walk.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>THE CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p><i>If in God’s Fear, </i>Candid Reader<i>, thou appliest thyself to consider
this System of Religion here delivered, with its Consistency
and Harmony, as well in itself as with the Scriptures of Truth, I
doubt not but thou wilt say with me and many more, that this is
the spiritual Day of Christ’s Appearance, wherein he is again revealing
the ancient Paths of Truth and Righteousness. For thou
mayest observe here the </i>Christian Religion<i> in all its Parts truly
established and vindicated, as it is a living, inward, spiritual, pure,
and substantial Thing, and not a mere Form, Shew, Shadow, Notion
and Opinion, as too many have hitherto held it, whose Fruits
declare they wanted that which they bear the Name of; and yet
many of those are so in Love with their empty Forms and Shadows,
that they cease not to calumniate us for commending and calling them
to the Substance, as we therefore denied or neglected the true
Form and outward Part of Christianity, which indeed is, as God the
Searcher of Hearts knows, a very great Slander. Thus, because
we have desired People earnestly to feel after God </i>near<i> and </i>in
themselves<i>, telling them that their Notions of God, as he is beyond
the Clouds, will little avail them, if they do not feel him near;
hence they have fought maliciously to infer that we deny any God
except that which is within us. Because we tell People, That it is
the </i>Light<i> and </i>Law within<i>, and not the </i>Letter without<i>, that
can truly tell them their Condition, and lead them out of all Evil;
hence they say, we vilify the </i>Scriptures<i>, and set up our own Imaginations
above them. Because we tell them, That it is not their talking
or believing of Christ’s outward Life, Sufferings, Death, and Resurrection,
no more than the </i>Jews<i> crying, </i>The Temple of the Lord<i>,
</i>the Temple of the Lord<i>, that will serve their Turn, or justify
them in the Sight of God; but that they must know </i>Christ<i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a>[Pg 503]</span>
</i>them<i>, whom they have crucified, to be raised, and to justify
them, and redeem them from their Iniquities: Hence they say, We
deny the Life, Death, and Sufferings of Christ, Justification by his
Blood, and Remission of Sins through him. Because we tell them,
while they are talking and determining about the </i>Resurrection<i>,
that they have more Need to know the </i>Just One<i>, whom they have
slain, </i>raised in themselves<i>, and to be sure they are Partakers of
the </i>first Resurrection<i>; and that this be, they will be the more
capable to judge of the </i>Second<i>: Hence they say, That we deny the
Resurrection of the Body. Because when we hear them talk foolishly
of Heaven and Hell, and the last Judgment, we exhort them
to come out of that hellish Condition they are in, and come down to
the Judgment of Christ </i>in their own Hearts<i>, and believe in the
Light, and follow it, that so they may come to sit in the heavenly
Places that are in Christ Jesus: Hence they maliciously say, that we
deny any Heaven or Hell but that which is within us, and that
we deny any general Judgment; which </i>Slanders<i> the Lord knows
are foully cast upon us, whom God hath raised for this End, and
gathered us, that by us he might confound the Wisdom of the Wise,
and bring to Nought the Understanding of the Prudent; and might,
in and by his own Spirit and Power in a despised People (that no
Flesh might glory in his Presence) pull down that dead, dark, corrupt
Image, and mere Shadow and Shell of Christianity wherewith
Antichrist hath deceived the Nations: For which End he hath called
us to be a First-fruits of those that serve him, and worship him no
more in the Oldness of the Letter, but in the Newness of the Spirit.
And though we be few in Number, in Respect of others; and weak as
to outward Strength, which we also altogether reject, and foolish
if compared with the wise Ones of this World; yet as God hath
prospered us, notwithstanding much Opposition, so will he yet do,
that neither the Art, Wisdom, nor Violence of Men or Devils shall
be able to quench that </i>little Spark<i> that hath appeared; but it shall
grow to the consuming of whatsoever shall stand up to oppose it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a>[Pg 504]</span>
The </i>Mouth of the Lord<i> hath spoken it! Yea, He that hath arisen
in a small Remnant shall arise and go on by the same Arm of Power
in his spiritual Manifestation, until he hath conquered all his Enemies,
until all the Kingdoms of the Earth become the Kingdom of
Christ Jesus.</i></p>

<p class="hang p2">Unto Him that hath begun this Work, not among the
Rich or Great Ones, but among the Poor and Small,
and hath revealed it not to the Wise and Learned, but
unto the Poor, unto Babes and Sucklings; even to Him,
the Only Wise and Omnipotent GOD, be Honour,
Glory, Thanksgiving, and Renown, from henceforth and
for ever. <i>Amen. Hallelu-JAH.</i></p>

<h2><a name="TN" id="TN"></a>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE.</h2>
<p>Archaic, obsolete, unusual and spellings and words have been maintained. Obvious misspellings have been fixed,
and some words and names have been standardized within the document. The "errata" which are noted in the book
have been applied and no further note of them will be made here. Sidenotes in the original book that were just
citations have been converted to footnotes. Changes to the book are noted in the text like <span class="correction" title="...with mouseover of the correction">this</span>.</p>
<p>Some programs will display the longer Hebrew phrase on Page 218 with the words in
the correct order and some reversed. Unfortunately there does not
appear to be a way to get uniformity in rendering.</p>
<p>The Table of Contents was inserted by the transcriber, it was not in the original book.
<span class="mobile-only">The cover was produced by the transcriber and is placed in the public domain.</span></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
